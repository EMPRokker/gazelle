Tags are just an aid to searching - in fact they are nothing more than searchable keywords. The uploader may or may not add the correct tags, or may only add a couple - when for effective searching it could do with a few more. The community tagging system is a way of trying to get appropriate and useful tags on every torrent without draconian tag rules for uploaders and without having staff whos only job is to tag stuff (a solution I have seen on other sites).\r\n\r\nSo I see no reason for uploaders to be defensive about the tags on their uploads changing. Tags are not for uploaders, they are for pervs trying to find stuff. Don\'t be upset if your tags change, be glad that more pervs can find your upload now. \r\n\r\nAs far as telling uploaders of tag changes by PM... I dunno I have changed a few tags on emp.me and I never PM\'d anyone :lol: If that upset anybody then... I dunno maybe they shouldnt be so butthurt when their crappy tags get corrected?? Technically we could have notifications sent to the uploader but I dont like the idea, firstly it will generate a large volume of PM traffic saying very little - internal junkmail imo - and secondly it gives credence to this idea that the uploader has some ownership of the tags for their upload, when really they dont, they just set the initial state but then the tags belong to the tracker community - which is as it should be in my eyes.[/quote]\r\nthanks for the explanation and no objections from me with that\r\n\r\nI like the idea of USB being tag monitor tho :grin:',NULL,NULL),(44306,5681,48010,'2012-07-17 09:47:04','[quote=Clownius]The server this is on has crashed badly at least twice today :banghead: ...

These actions can be warnings, deleting torrents, PM\'s sent to the uploader, bonus payments to the reporter, lots of serious stuff can be carried out at the press of a button so be sure what you are doing!\r\n\r\nThe advantadge to all this is that once you have got the hang of the system you can deal with torrent reports very quickly, and with standardised replies and actions etc.\r\n\r\nRe: the other reports. Yes, they are very very simple... perhaps too simple? :hmmm: I wonder if we could do something clever and make the other reports (non torrents reports) mesh with the staff messaging system, if those reports were instead staff messages we would have a much better system to deal with them which is hooked up to the message templates etc.\r\n',NULL,NULL),(44329,5721,84499,'2012-07-17 16:11:33','\r\n\r\nBut you are using the forum search!!

Tags are just an aid to searching - in fact they are nothing more than searchable keywords. The uploader may or may not add the correct tags, or may only add a couple - when for effective searching it could do with a few more. The community tagging system is a way of trying to get appropriate and useful tags on every torrent without draconian tag rules for uploaders and without having staff whos only job is to tag stuff (a solution I have seen on other sites).\r\n\r\nSo I see no reason for uploaders to be defensive about the tags on their uploads changing. Tags are not for uploaders, they are for pervs trying to find stuff. Don\'t be upset if your tags change, be glad that more pervs can find your upload now. \r\n\r\nAs far as telling uploaders of tag changes by PM... I dunno I have changed a few tags on emp.me and I never PM\'d anyone :lol: If that upset anybody then... I dunno maybe they shouldnt be so butthurt when their crappy tags get corrected?? Technically we could have notifications sent to the uploader but I dont like the idea, firstly it will generate a large volume of PM traffic saying very little - internal junkmail imo - and secondly it gives credence to this idea that the uploader has some ownership of the tags for their upload, when really they dont, they just set the initial state but then the tags belong to the tracker community - which is as it should be in my eyes.[/quote]\r\n\r\none question i have in mind regarding the tags that will be added from other members. do the syno- replacer control them too? if not, you will have double triple thousands similar tags again.

Search for only the \'string\' even if blank, in the field. \n\nIve then closed the torrent page, reopened and the only difference is the clear default button is still present, but all torrents are showing.  (well, the 2 pages we see by default due to that next/last page issue)\n\nIll close ff now, and see if that makes a difference.\n\n\n[align=right][size=0][i]merged from thread[/i][br]\'BUG : On Browse Page, Search Term never clears\'[/size][/align]',86439,'2012-07-19 22:21:37'),(44420,5666,86439,'2012-07-19 22:21:48','I just clicked clear default, which is a different bug to what USB reported and which I was replying to. At no time is make default highlighted, nor do my searches go awry. They behave as expected.\n\n\nHowever, when i click clear default instead of just re-entering a string or leaving it blank, it does just remove the clear default button when the screen reloads, but the results page looks like it did prior to clicking it. That is, still limits torrents shown to the string which is still shown in the field.\n\nBased on that, being uneducated, I think it just fails to clear the search field. Because like I said, if its meant to clear defaults, I dont have any defaults set. Leaving that button alone, the system works as it should. But I imagine if the clear defaults button also cleared the search string field, then I would see what I do the other way of doing it, all torrents as the field would be blank.\n\ni could be wrong on that though.\n\n\nedit: Clicking enter, always brings up the reset defaults button, with a string, or left blank in the search field, but doesnt seem to do anything else. Nothing is highlighted though.\n\nI closed the browse page, reopened it, the clear default button is there still, but so are all torrents. Thats because I cleared the string field and hit enter. If I dont clear the string field, then whatever I typed last is the way the page opens.\n\nBut what USB was saying is that the first term he entered reappears despite searching for something else last.

While other browsers don\'t show the focus, they all perform the same action.\r\n\r\nRight now, if you have the \'Clear Default\' button available, click on it. On further searches, don\'t use Enter, but simply click on \'Filter Torrents\', you\'ll never experience this problem again, because this is how it should be working in the first place.\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=1BE5_50087970][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-1BE5_50087970.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=2B54_50087970][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-2B54_50087970.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nThis is just an example, dirty fix applied (only tested on Opera), \"Make Default\" will not receive the focus anymore, so hitting Enter will be the same as clicking on \"Filter Torrents\" :)\r\n\r\nHope you understood what I meant.\r\n\r\nNow, I gotta go, this ADSL roller coaster is killing me, up-down-up-down-down-down, fucking shitty signal D:\n\n[align=right][size=0][i]merged from thread[/i][br]\'BUG : On Browse Page, Search Term never clears\'[/size][/align]',129045,'2012-07-19 23:27:22'),(44425,5666,86439,'2012-07-19 23:19:08','The reason I search a blank string, is the list is filtered by whatever I type.

The following commands allow for registration and maintenance of nicknames; to use them, type /msg NickServ command. For more information on a specific command, type /msg NickServ HELP command.\n \n[b]REGISTER[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ REGISTER password [email]\n \n Registers your nickname in the NickServ database.  Once\n your nick is registered, you can use the SET and ACCESS\n commands to configure your nick\'s settings as you like\n them.  Make sure you remember the password you use when\n registering - you\'ll need it to make changes to your nick\n later.  (Note that case matters!  ANOPE, Anope, and\n anope are all different passwords!)\n \n Guidelines on choosing passwords:\n \n Passwords should not be easily guessable.  For example,\n using your real name as a password is a bad idea.  Using\n your nickname as a password is a much worse idea ;) and,\n in fact, NickServ will not allow it.  Also, short\n passwords are vulnerable to trial-and-error searches, so\n you should choose a password at least 5 characters long.\n Finally, the space character cannot be used in passwords.\n \n The parameter email is optional and will set the email\n for your nick immediately. However, it may be required\n on certain networks.\n Your privacy is respected; this e-mail won\'t be given to\n any third-party person.\n \n This command also creates a new group for your nickname,\n that will allow you to register other nicks later sharing\n the same configuration, the same set of memos and the\n same channel privileges. For more information on this\n feature, type /msg NickServ HELP GROUP.[/quote]\n \n[b]GROUP[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  GROUP target password\n \n This command makes your nickname join the target nickname\'s\n group. password is the password of the target nickname.\n \n Joining a group will allow you to share your configuration,\n memos, and channel privileges with all the nicknames in the\n group, and much more!\n \n A group exists as long as it is useful. This means that even\n if a nick of the group is dropped, you won\'t lose the\n shared things described above, as long as there is at\n least one nick remaining in the group.\n \n You can use this command even if you have not registered\n your nick yet. If your nick is already registered, you\'ll\n need to identify yourself before using this command. Type\n /msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more information. This\n last may be not possible on your IRC network.\n \n It is recommended to use this command with a non-registered\n nick because it will be registered automatically when\n using this command. You may use it with a registered nick (to\n change your group) only if your network administrators allowed\n it.\n \n You can only be in one group at a time. Group merging is\n not possible.\n \n Note: all the nicknames of a group have the same password.[/quote]\n \n[b]IDENTIFY[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  IDENTIFY password\n \n Tells NickServ that you are really the owner of this\n nick.  Many commands require you to authenticate yourself\n with this command before you use them.  The password\n should be the same one you sent with the REGISTER\n command.[/quote]\n \n[b]LOGOUT[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  LOGOUT\n \n This reverses the effect of the IDENTIFY command, i.e.\n make you not recognized as the real owner of the nick\n anymore. Note, however, that you won\'t be asked to reidentify\n yourself.[/quote]\n \n[b]DROP[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  DROP [nickname]\n \n Drops your nickname from the NickServ database.  A nick\n that has been dropped is free for anyone to re-register.\n \n You may drop a nick within your group by passing it\n as the nick parameter.\n \n In order to use this command, you must first identify\n with your password (/msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more\n information).[/quote]\n \n[b]ACCESS[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  ACCESS ADD mask\n         ACCESS DEL mask\n         ACCESS LIST\n \n Modifies or displays the access list for your nick.  This\n is the list of addresses which will be automatically\n recognized by NickServ as allowed to use the nick.  If\n you want to use the nick from a different address, you\n need to send an IDENTIFY command to make NickServ\n recognize you.\n \n Examples:\n \n     ACCESS ADD anyone@*.bepeg.com\n         Allows access to user anyone from any machine in\n         the bepeg.com domain.\n \n     ACCESS DEL anyone@*.bepeg.com\n         Reverses the previous command.\n \n     ACCESS LIST\n         Displays the current access list.[/quote]\n\n[b]SET[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET option parameters\n \n Sets various nickname options.  option can be one of:\n \n     DISPLAY    Set the display of your group in Services\n     PASSWORD   Set your nickname password\n     LANGUAGE   Set the language Services will use when\n                    sending messages to you\n     URL        Associate a URL with your nickname\n     EMAIL      Associate an E-mail address with your nickname\n     ICQ        Associate an ICQ number with your nickname\n     GREET      Associate a greet message with your nickname\n     KILL       Turn protection on or off\n     SECURE     Turn nickname security on or off\n     PRIVATE    Prevent your nickname from appearing in a\n                    /msg NickServ LIST\n     HIDE       Hide certain pieces of nickname information\n     MSG        Change the communication method of Services\n     AUTOOP     Should services op you automatically.\n \n In order to use this command, you must first identify\n with your password (/msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more\n information).\n \n Type /msg NickServ HELP SET option for more information\n on a specific option.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET DISPLAY[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET DISPLAY new-display\n \n Changes the display used to refer to your nickname group in\n Services. The new display MUST be a nick of your group.[/quote]\n\n[b]SET PASSWORD[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET PASSWORD new-password\n \n Changes the password used to identify you as the nick\'s\n owner.[/quote]\n\n[b]SET URL[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET URL url\n \n Associates the given URL with your nickname.  This URL\n will be displayed whenever someone requests information\n on your nick with the INFO command.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET EMAIL[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET EMAIL address\n \n Associates the given E-mail address with your nickname.\n This address will be displayed whenever someone requests\n information on the nickname with the INFO command.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET HIDE[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET HIDE {EMAIL | STATUS | USERMASK | QUIT} {ON | OFF}\n \n Allows you to prevent certain pieces of information from\n being displayed when someone does a NickServ INFO on your\n nick.  You can hide your E-mail address (EMAIL), last seen\n user@host mask (USERMASK), your services access status\n (STATUS) and  last quit message (QUIT).\n The second parameter specifies whether the information should\n be displayed (OFF) or hidden (ON).[/quote]\n \n[b]SET ICQ[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET ICQ number\n \n Associates the given ICQ number with your nickname.  This\n number will be displayed whenever someone requests\n information on your nick with the INFO command.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET GREET[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET GREET message\n \n Makes the given message the greet of your nickname, that\n will be displayed when joining a channel that has GREET\n option enabled, provided that you have the necessary\n access on it.[/quote]\n\n[b]SET KILL[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET KILL {ON | QUICK | IMMED | OFF}\n \n Turns the automatic protection option for your nick\n on or off.  With protection on, if another user\n tries to take your nick, they will be given one minute to\n change to another nick, after which NickServ will forcibly change\n their nick.\n \n If you select QUICK, the user will be given only 20 seconds\n to change nicks instead of the usual 60.  If you select\n IMMED, user\'s nick will be changed immediately without being\n warned first or given a chance to change their nick; please\n do not use this option unless necessary.  Also, your\n network\'s administrators may have disabled this option.[/quote]\n\n[b]SET SECURE[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET SECURE {ON | OFF}\n \n Turns NickServ\'s security features on or off for your\n nick.  With SECURE set, you must enter your password\n before you will be recognized as the owner of the nick,\n regardless of whether your address is on the access\n list.  However, if you are on the access list, NickServ\n will not auto-kill you regardless of the setting of the\n KILL option.[/quote]\n\n[b]SET PRIVATE[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET PRIVATE {ON | OFF}\n \n Turns NickServ\'s privacy option on or off for your nick.\n With PRIVATE set, your nickname will not appear in\n nickname lists generated with NickServ\'s LIST command.\n (However, anyone who knows your nickname can still get\n information on it using the INFO command.)[/quote]\n\n[b]SET MSG[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET MSG {ON | OFF}\n \n Allows you to choose the way Services are communicating with\n you. With MSG set, Services will use messages, else they\'ll\n use notices.[/quote]\n\n[b]UPDATE[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  UPDATE\n Updates your current status, i.e. it checks for new memos,\n sets needed chanmodes (ModeonID) and updates your vhost and\n your userflags (lastseentime, etc).[/quote]\n \n[b]RECOVER[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  RECOVER nickname [password]\n \n Allows you to recover your nickname if someone else has\n taken it; this does the same thing that NickServ does\n automatically if someone tries to use a kill-protected\n nick.\n \n When you give this command, NickServ will bring a fake\n user online with the same nickname as the user you\'re\n trying to recover your nick from.  This causes the IRC\n servers to disconnect the other user.  This fake user will\n remain online for NickServ to ensure that the other\n user does not immediately reconnect; after that time, you\n can reclaim your nick.  Alternatively, use the RELEASE\n command (/msg NickServ HELP RELEASE) to get the nick\n back sooner.\n \n In order to use the RECOVER command for a nick, your\n current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick\'s\n access list, you must be identified and in the group of\n that nick, or you must supply the correct password for\n the nickname.[/quote]\n\n[b]RELEASE[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  RELEASE nickname [password]\n \n Instructs NickServ to remove any hold on your nickname\n caused by automatic kill protection or use of the RECOVER\n command.  This holds lasts for NickServ;\n this command gets rid of them sooner.\n \n In order to use the RELEASE command for a nick, your\n current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick\'s\n access list, you must be identified and in the group of\n that nick, or you must supply the correct password for\n the nickname.[/quote]\n\n[b]GHOST[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  GHOST nickname [password]\n \n Terminates a \"ghost\" IRC session using your nick.  A\n \"ghost\" session is one which is not actually connected,\n but which the IRC server believes is still online for one\n reason or another.  Typically, this happens if your\n computer crashes or your Internet or modem connection\n goes down while you\'re on IRC.\n \n In order to use the GHOST command for a nick, your\n current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick\'s\n access list, you must be identified and in the group of\n that nick, or you must supply the correct password for\n the nickname.[/quote]\n \n[b]INFO[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  INFO nickname [ALL]\n \n Displays information about the given nickname, such as\n the nick\'s owner, last seen address and time, and nick\n options. If you are identified for the nick you\'re\n getting information for and ALL is specified, you will\n be shown all the information; regardless of whether\n it\'s hidden or not.[/quote]\n \n[b]LIST[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  LIST pattern\n \n Lists all registered nicknames which match the given\n pattern, in nick!user@host format.  Nicks with the\n PRIVATE option set will not be displayed.\n \n Examples:\n \n     LIST *!joeuser@foo.com\n         Lists all nicks owned by joeuser@foo.com.\n \n     LIST *Bot*!*@*\n         Lists all registered nicks with Bot in their\n         names (case insensitive).\n \n     LIST *!*@*.bar.org\n         Lists all nicks owned by users in the bar.org\n         domain.[/quote]\n\n[b]ALIST[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  ALIST [level]\n \n Lists all channels you have access on. Optionally, you can specify\n a level in XOP or ACCESS format. The resulting list will only\n include channels where you have the given level of access.\n\n Examples:\n     ALIST Founder\n         Lists all channels where you have Founder\n         access.\n\n     ALIST AOP\n         Lists all channels where you have AOP\n         access or greater.\n\n     ALIST 10\n         Lists all channels where you have level 10\n         access or greater.\n\n Channels that have the NOEXPIRE option set will be\n prefixed by an exclamation mark.[/quote]\n[b]GLIST[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  GLIST\n \n Lists all nicks in your group.[/quote]\n[b]STATUS[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  STATUS nickname...\n \n Returns whether the user using the given nickname is\n recognized as the owner of the nickname.  The response has\n this format:\n \n     nickname status-code\n \n where nickname is the nickname sent with the command, and\n status-code is one of the following:\n \n     0 - no such user online or nickname not registered\n     1 - user not recognized as nickname\'s owner\n     2 - user recognized as owner via access list only\n     3 - user recognized as owner via password identification\n \n Up to sixteen nicknames may be sent with each command; the\n rest will be ignored.

The most notable of these is that registering your nickname prevents other people from using it. Once a user starts using the nickname, they will be asked to â€˜identifyâ€™ to it with a password. If they fail to do so, their nickname will be changed. This helps to stop people posing as you.\n\nOnce you register your nickname, you can be added to the auto voice and op lists in other peopleâ€™s channels. This enables you to be a permanent staff member in channels. You are also entitled to a vhost once you have been registered.\n\nRegistration provides you with many benefits and is completely free.\n\nTo register your nickname on Empornium IRC, you must first be using it. If you are not currently using it, change to it with the command:\n\n[quote]/nick <nickname>[/quote]\n\nFor example:\n\n[quote]/nick CrazyUser[/quote]\n\nOnce you are using the nickname, you may register it in one of two ways. In any client, use the following command:\n\n[quote]/ns register <password> <e-mail>[/quote]\n\nFor example:\n\n[quote]/ns register supersecretpassword crazyuser@hotmail.com[/quote]\n\nFollowing this, you will be sent an e-mail giving you the details required to finish off the registration. Follow the instructions in the e-mail.\n\nEach time you connect and start using the registered, you will be told that â€œThis nick is owned by someone elseâ€. You must â€˜identifyâ€™ to it using the following command:\n\n[quote]/ns identify <password>[/quote]\n\nFor example:\n\n[quote]/ns identify supersecretpassword[/quote]\n\nIf you use mIRC, you can load the following script into the Remotes section of your script editor (press alt+R to access this) to identify you automatically. Just replace â€˜YOURPASSWORDHEREâ€™ with your actual password:\n\non 1:NOTICE:*This nickname is registered and protected*:?: {\n   if ($nick == NickServ) {\n      ns identify YOURPASSWORDHERE\n   }\n}\n\non 1:NOTICE:*This nick is owned by someone else*:?: {\n   if ($nick == NickServ) {\n      ns identify YOURPASSWORDHERE\n   }\n}\n\nIf you require help, come and see us in [url=http://torrents.empornium.me/irc.php]#empornium-help on irc.emprn.tk[/url].

These include:\n\nIncreased control over your channel\nAbility to add people to the auto op list\nAbility to add auto kicks\nAbility to use a services bot to auto moderate your channel\nAnd many many moreâ€¦\nTo register your channel, you must first register your nickname. To do this, when you are using the nickname that you wish to register, type the following command into your IRC client:\n\n[quote]/ns register password e-mail[/quote]\n\nYou must replace password and e-mail with a real password and e-mail address, respectively. An example of the use of this command is:\n\n[quote]/ns register supersecretpassword fred@hotmail.com[/quote]\n\nIt is important that you use your real e-mail address as this will be used in future if you ever forget your password. We will not send any unsolicited e-mail to this address.\n\nOnce you have registered your nickname, you can register your channel. All channels names begin with the # symbol, for example #help, #chris and #247fixes. Once you have picked a channel name, you can join it using the command:\n\n[quote]/join #channel[/quote]\n\nFor example:\n\n[quote]/join #chat[/quote]\n\nOnce you have joined the channel, if it is not already registered, you should see your name in the nickname list with the @ symbol next to it. This means you are an operator in the channel. You may now register it with the following command:\n\n[quote]/cs register #channel password description[/quote]\n\nYou must replace #channel, password and description with the channel name, the channel password and a description of the channel. An example of the use of this command is:\n\n[quote]/cs register #chat verysecretpassword Freds chat channel[/quote]\n\nOnce you have done that, you should see your name in the nick list prefixed with the ~ symbol. This means you are the owner of the channel.\n\nIf you have any problems registering your channel, come and talk to us in #empornium-help on irc.emprn.tk\n',70679,'2012-09-11 19:11:22'),(44638,5757,47234,'2012-07-21 22:02:52','Blame me and Lanz lol.

Itâ€™s an online equivalent of a short timeout, where the person has to sit quietly for several minutes before rejoining discussion.\n\nTo silence a user manually, youâ€™d type:\n\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +bb ~q:nick!ident@user.host ~n:nick!ident@user.host[/quote]\nThat command sets two bans, which is why the host information is listed twice. The first one (~q:nick!ident@user.host) prevents the user from participating in the discussion (unless the user is +v or higher). The ~q stands for quiet. The second one (~n: nick!ident user.host) prevents the user from changing nicks. The ~n stands for nick.\n\nIn #YourChannel, bans are normally set by the userâ€™s host, so an example ban would look like this:\n\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +bb ~n:*!*@protectedhost-1234578.hsd1.va.comcast.net ~q:*!*@protectedhost-1234578.hsd1.va.comcast.net[/quote]\nThat example bans anyone (with any nick or ident) with the hostmask protectedhost-12345678.hsd1.va.comcast.net.\n\n \n[b]Removing a Silence Extended Ban[/b]\nIf you silence a user manually, you have to remove the ban manually as well. Since you set the ban with +b, you will remove it by using the same command, but with -b. So to remove the ban, you would type:\n\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel -bb ~q:nick!ident@user.host ~n:nick!ident@user.host[/quote]\nEverything is the same. Youâ€™re just removing the ban. Hereâ€™s the way to remove the example ban from above:\n\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel -bb ~n:*!*@protectedhost-1234578.hsd1.va.comcast.net ~q:*!*@protectedhost-1234578.hsd1.va.comcast.net[/quote]\n \n[b]Setting a Channel Extended Ban[/b]\nThere are two other kinds of extended bans:\n\n~c sets an extended ban based on a channel users are in\n~r sets an extended ban based on a userâ€™s real name\nYou are unlikely to need either of these bans, but for the sake of thoroughness here is how they work.\n\nTo set an extended channel ban, youâ€™d type:\n\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +b ~c:#channel[/quote]\nThat ban would prevent anyone in #channel from joining #YourChannel.\n\nLetâ€™s pretend thereâ€™s a channel called #YourChannelHaters. We might decide that we do not want anyone from #YourChannelHaters to join #YourChannel. We could use this extended ban to prevent them from joining #YourChannel:\n\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +b ~c:#YourChannelHaters[/quote]\nYou remove this kind of ban by switching to -b, so I could remove the ban on folks from #YourChannelHaters like this:\n\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel -b ~c:#YourChannelHaters[/quote]\n \n[b]Setting a Real Name Extended Ban[/b]\nTo set an extended ban based on a userâ€™s real name, youâ€™d type:\n\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +b ~r:*real_name*[/quote]\nThe * character works as a wildcard, just as it does in other bans. Use the underscore character ( _ ) to represent spaces in the userâ€™s real name. The underscore is also interpreted as an actual underscore character. In other words, the ban above would block someone using either â€œreal nameâ€ (with a space) or â€œreal_nameâ€ (with an underscore).\n\nHereâ€™s an example: \n\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +b ~r:*Jane_Doe*[/quote]\nThat ban would prevent anyone who was using the real name â€œJane Doeâ€ or â€œJane_Doeâ€ from joining #YourChannel. Because of the * wildcard, someone with a real name like â€œJane Doe rulesâ€ or â€œJane_Doe_rulesâ€ would also be banned.\n\nYou remove this kind of ban by switching to -b, so I could remove the ban on â€œJane Doe â€ like this:\n\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel -b ~r:*Jane_Doe*[/quote]',70679,'2012-09-10 21:42:11'),(44643,5763,85636,'2012-07-21 22:52:07','[size=3][b][color=#FF0000]Moved to staff irc reference - delete after double check[/color][/b][/size]\n\n\n[b][u]Channel Flood Protection[/u][/b]\n\nThe +f channel mode provides comprehensive flood protection for a channel. This mode allows you to prevent join, nick change, CTCP, text, and knock floods. The syntax for this modeâ€™s parameter is as follows:\n\n[quote]/mode #channel +f [{#}{,...}]:[/quote]\n\nThe amount specifies the number of times the specified flood must occur before action is taken. \n\nBelow are the available types:\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td] Type [/td][td] Name [/td][td] Default Action [/td][td] Other Actions [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td] c [/td][td] CTCP [/td][td] +C (no channel CTCPs allowed) [/td][td] +m (only voiced users can speak), +M (only registered users can speak) [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td] j [/td][td] Join [/td][td] +i (invite only) [/td][td] R (only registered users can join) [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td] k [/td][td] Knock [/td][td] +K (no knocks allowed) [/td][td] None [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td] m [/td][td] Message [/td][td] +m (only voiced users can speak) [/td][td] +M (only registered users can speak) [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td] n [/td][td] Nickname Change [/td][td] +N (no nickname changes allowed) [/td][td] None [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td] t [/td][td] text [/td][td] User is kicked from the channel [/td][td] +b (user is banned from the channel) [/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\nN.B. The difference between type [b]m[/b] and [b]t[/b] is that [b]m[/b] is tallied for the entire channel whereas [b]t[/b] is tallied per user.\n\nIf you choose to specify an action for a mode, you may also specify a time (in minutes) after which the specific action will be reversed.\n\nAn example of the use of this command is:\n\n[quote]/mode #chills +f [2c#C5,6j#R3,3k#K10,15m#m5,5n#N3,5t#b60]:5[/quote]\n\nThis meansâ€¦\n\nIf there are 2 channel CTCP messages (2c) in 5 seconds(:5) set mode +C for 5 mins (#C5)\nIf there are 6 joins (6j) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +R for 3 mins (#R3)\nIf there are 3 /KNOCK commands on the channel (3k) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +K for 10 mins (#K10)\nIf there are 15 messages in total from all users (15m) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +m for 5 mins (#m5)\nIf there are 5 nickname changes (n5) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +N for 3 mins (#N3)\nIf there are 5 messages from any single user (5t) in 5 seconds (:5) ban the user for 60 mins (#b60)\n\n\nIt has been observed lately that bot nets are joining channels and rapidly joining and parting. In order to prevent this, you can use channel mode [b]j[/b]. This mode will allow only x joins to your channel in y seconds for each client. The recommended setting for this is 1 join in 1 second as this will entirely eradicate join/part flooding from botnets. An example of the use of this is:\n\n[quote]/mode #chills +j 1:1[/quote]\n\nIf you need any help, come and see us in #empornium-help on irc.emprn.tk',70679,'2012-09-11 19:55:43'),(44644,5763,85636,'2012-07-21 22:58:56','[size=3][b][color=#FF0000]Moved to staff irc reference - delete after double check[/color][/b][/size]\n\n\n\n[b][u]Channel Passwords[/u][/b]\n\n\nIf you ever had a secret password to get into your clubhouse, you understand the way that channel keys work. You can set a channel key for your channel, and only those people who have the key will be able to join the channel. If you want to have private conversations, using a channel key is a simple way to make it happen.\n\n[b][u]Setting a Channel Key[/u][/b]\n\nTo set a channel key, use this command:\n\n[quote]/mode #channel +k channelkey[/quote] \n\nIn that command, replace \"channel\" with your #channel and replace \"channelkey\" with your channel key (your password). For instance, for my super-secret channel, I used this command:\n\n[quote]/mode #baconmylove +k nomnomnom [/quote] \n\nWhen you set a channel key, everyone in the channel will see the new key. When I set my channel key, for instance, the server announced this in the channel:\n\n * MrRandom sets mode: +k nomnomnom\n\n[b][u]TIPS[/u][/b]\n\nBe sure that you choose a strong password that others will not easily guess. \n\nMake sure you remove anyone you do not want to have the key before you set it. You can ask him to leave OR kick and ban if necessary. Remember that the server announces the key in channel when you set it, so everyone in your channel will see the new key.\n\nAnyone who has half-op status or higher in your channel can change the channel key. If you cannot trust someone, donâ€™t make that person a moderator. He could easily change the password and lock everyone out of the channel! This can be fixed by doing [quote]/cs clear #channel modes[/quote]\n\nThe channel key will only remain as long as someone is in the channel. If everyone leaves, the next person who joins will be able to do so without knowing the channel key. The easiest solution to this problem is either to add a bnc user to the channel or create a private bot to occupy the channel. Note that services bots will not hold a channel open.\n\n\n[u][b]Joining a Channel with a Key[/b][/u]\n\nYou need to provide the password to join your channel now once you set your key. Hereâ€™s how to use the JOIN command with a channel key:\n\n[quote]/join #channel password[/quote]\n\nFor my super-secret channel, I used this command:\n\n[quote]/join #baconmylove nomnomnom[/quote]\n\nYouâ€™ll need to give your password and this command to everyone who you want to grant access to your channel. Only give your channel password to the people you trust with access to your private space.\n\n[b][u]Changing your Channel Key[/u][/b]\n\nTo change your channel key, just use the same command with a new password:\n\n/mode #channel +k newchannelkey \nThe command is exactly the same. You just indicate the new channel key when you use the command.\n\n[b][u]Troubleshooting[/u][/b]\n\nYou see this error message in your status window: #channel :Cannot join channel (+k)\nEither you didnâ€™t include the password or you used the wrong password. Check with the channel owner for the correct password or to ask for access to the channel.\n\nYou get locked out of your own channel.\nIf you forget your password or someone else changes it, you can just change your channel key and join with the new key. If a moderator in your channel changed the password without your permission, you may want to talk to that person or remove his access. Remember you should only add people as half-ops, ops, or admins if you trust them completely.\n\nIf you are an owner who gets locked out of your channel join the network help channel #silentzombies-help @ irc.emprn.tk they will help you get your channel back.',70679,'2012-09-11 19:27:27'),(44645,5763,85636,'2012-07-21 23:03:40','[size=3][b][color=#FF0000]Moved as is to to staff operator reference - Delete after double check[/color][/b][/size]\n\n\n[b]Hide your Channel[/b]\n\n[b]Secret vs. Private[/b]\n\nThere are two modes you can use to hide your channel: [b]+s[/b], for a secret channel; and [b]+p[/b], for a private channel.\n\nOriginally (that is, in earlier days of IRC), there was a difference between these two modes. On Empornium IRC, the two commands do the same thing. If you set your channel to [b]+p[/b] or to [b]+s[/b], your channel will not show up in the channel listing that someone gets after using the /LIST command and in a /WHOIS list for a user who is in the channel (unless the person using the command is also in the secret channel)\n\nSince the two commands do the same thing, you can only set one or the other.\n\n[b]Setting the Secret or Private Mode[/b]\n\nTo set the secret mode, use this command:\n\n[quote]/mode #channel +s[/quote]\n\nIn that command, replace \"channel\" with your #channel. For instance, for my super-secret channel, I used this command:\n\n[quote]/mode #baconmylove +s[/quote] \n\nTo set the private mode, use this command:\n\n[quote]/mode #channel +p[/quote]\n\nFor instance, I used this command:\n\n[quote]/mode #baconmylove +p[/quote]\n  \n[b]Restrictions on the +s and +p Modes[/b]\n\nIf you set your channel to +s and then decide to set +p, the server will respond by removing the +s setting. Youâ€™d see something like this:\n\n[quote]* MrRandom sets mode: +s\n* MrRandom sets mode: +p-s[/quote]\n\nIn the second line, the server set +p (adding the private setting), and [b]-s[/b] (removing the secret setting). This is normal. Since the commands do the same thing, you only need one or the other (never both). As long as you have the channel set to [b]+s[/b] or to [b]+p[/b], it will be hidden.\n\n[b]Removing the Secret or Private Mode[/b]\n\nIf you no longer want your channel to be hidden, you can remove the secret or private mode easily:\n\nTo remove the secret mode, use this command:\n\n[quote]/mode #channel -s[/quote]\n\nTo remove the private mode, use this command:\n\n[quote]/mode #channel -p[/quote]\n\nOnce you remove the setting, your channel will be visible to everyone on the network.\n\n[b]Two Tips on Using the Secret or Private Mode[/b]\n\nRemember that even though your channel is hidden, the people you ask to join you in the channel can tell others about it. Only invite people to join your channel if you trust them to maintain your privacy. If you cannot trust someone not to tell others about the space, donâ€™t ask them to join your channel.\n\nAny moderator (half-ops, ops, and admins) on your channel can change the channel mode. Donâ€™t add someone as a moderator in the channel if you cannot trust that person to leave the channel with the settings you want.',70679,'2012-09-11 19:22:02'),(44646,5755,86439,'2012-07-21 23:13:24','A possible Help Tute.\n\n\nDont fall into the Hole     OR    Dig yourself out of the Hole    OR     My ratio is fucked, help me     OR      Tips for keeping a good ratio\n\n\nBe aware\n - Choose your torrents carefully.\n\n - Download the entire torrent, DL\'ing less than 100% of all files will prevent that torrent awarding credits.\n\n - Seed, seed everything, never delete it (at least not until its replaced), they help you get credits which can be converted to ratio DL reductions. Thus improving your ratio without having to actually upload a byte. This is not a replacement for ratio, its merely recognition of genuine attempts to seed back where there is a genuine lack of leechers.\n\n - While seed/leecher ratio is a guide to the potential to seed back, be aware that if the torrent has multiple files, and its a few days old, theres a good chance many of those leechers are in essence pseudo seeds now. Many fall into this trap. They will always be listed as leechers due to not completing every last file in that torrent. They never become listed as seeds. Thats not a big deal for them (except as mentioned re: Credits) but it is a big deal for you, they will not DL from you which is what you\'re comparing seed/leecher ratios for in the first place.\n\n - Freeleech, look for fresh (less than a day old) freeleech torrents (gold coin here). And dont DL normal torrents until you have a good ratio buffer.\n\n\nBe patient, and control yourself\n - Never DL an old torrent, no matter how much you want it, until you have a buffer large enough to cover it. You will not seed this back to 1:1 for years, if ever. Once you have that buffer, go for it and enjoy the older stuff and keep it seeding for the benefit of others. Theres a caveat to this concept. Old torrents can be good providers of UL, when youre among the last seeders, often you will be the only one seeding at a particular time, so when uploading you might just gain a good ratio boost on that one torrent late as the other seeders delete it from their client and or HDD. But it generally wont happen in the short term.\n\n - Build a buffer using any or all of the techniques listed here, with an appropriate buffer you never need worry too much about ratio. This is a guessing game to some degree, although you can keep an eye on its progress by watching your ratio. Your buffer should be a reflection of how much you DL each week, and how much you can upload each week. ie: If you like about 20 gig of stuff each month, you would want to upload in excess of that amount. In the early stages this seems limiting, but as the first month or two progresses you will have more torrents seeding, and more credits accumulating. This is the buffer you want, but you need to build it, and building takes some time. I would choose a buffer that was at least double what I want each month. Just keep an eye on it to make sure you dont forget ratio, things do change.\n\n\nIf thats not enough, check out this http://empornium.mooo.com/articles.php?topic=getting_out_of_troub',86439,'2012-07-21 23:48:02'),(44647,5755,129045,'2012-07-21 23:19:12','FLS can edit articles... should I be fixing the minor stuff I pointed out? :hmmm:\r\n\r\nSeems pretty straight forward, but I don\'t want to screw anything :P',129045,'2012-07-21 23:19:45'),(44648,5755,84499,'2012-07-21 23:40:35','\r\n\r\nYes FLS can and should edit articles, minor corrections and stuff I think its okay if you go ahead...

You might be wondering â€œdo I need to register a new nick and have people add that nick to access lists as well? Certainly there must be an easier way.â€\n\nWell luckily for you, there is. You are able to group nicks together so that permissions and other data are shared among accounts. Some of the items that are shared include (but are not limited to): channel ownership, permission levels (owner, halfop, etc.) on channels, group info that was provided when you registered, password, and virtual host. Pretty much anything your single nick has associated with it will be associated with the group of nicks that you have registered.\n\nHereâ€™s how to group a nick to one that you already have registered:\n\n* Switch to the nick that you want to group\n       NOTE 1: Before you enter the next command, make sure that you are using the nick you want to add to your \n       existing group. Do NOT be using your main nick. Example: if I wanted to group JayneCobb to my account, I \n       would /nick JayneCobb.\n       NOTE 2: If you use a registered nick when the next step if performed, it will first be dropped, then \n       grouped to the main nick. Example: if I try to group JayneCobb (which is registered) to my main nick \n       MalcolmReynolds, Services will first drop JayneCobb, then have it join the MalcolmReynolds group. By being \n       dropped, any permissions JayneCobb had will be gone.\n\n* Enter the following command in the server/status window: \n[quote]/msg nickserv group main_nick password[/quote] \n       where main_nick is your primary nick, and password is the password belonging to the primary nick.\n\n[quote]Example: I want to group JayneCobb to my primary nick, MalcolmReynolds, and the password for it is S3reni+yV@ll3y (you do use something secure for your passwords, right?). I would type the following as JayneCobb: /msg nickserv group MalcolmReynolds S3reni+yV@ll3y[/quote]\n\nLook for nickserv to either tell you that you have joined the group of your primay nick or give you an error message, such as â€œyou must wait at least 60 seconds before using the group command againâ€.\n\nAnd just to give you the commands again, they are, in order:\n\n[quote]/nick theNewNick[/quote]\n[quote]/msg nickserv group main_nick password[/quote]\n\nNow what if you want to delink a nick, i.e. remove it from the group, is there some way to do that? Yes there is, you just drop it by switching to the nick, and doing \n[quote]/msg nickserv drop [/quote]\nDoing that will make nickserv completely drop the nick â€“ it will no longer exist, have any permissions, etc.\n\nIs there someway to delink it without dropping, or without it losing the permissions and other information? Not currently, although I suppose it is possible that it could end up in a future version of services, or someone could create a module that could drop a nick and register it using the credentials of the former group and preserving permissions, etc.\n\nShould you have any questions about grouping nicks, feel free to leave a comment here, or to join #empornium-help and ask in there.',70679,'2012-09-10 18:11:37'),(44653,5757,47234,'2012-07-22 01:41:28','Could we link the connectable article to the conn-checker or could i just copy and paste the article back and have it hidden in tutorials on only viable on the conn checker page.  sadly i cant just copy and paste back as i cant remember the url for conn-checker',NULL,NULL),(44654,5679,47234,'2012-07-22 01:44:07','Thrown 10 slots and 100k credits at both PornJacker and Belam to use for testing',47234,'2012-07-22 01:44:19'),(44655,5763,85636,'2012-07-22 01:44:38','[size=3][b][color=#FF0000]Moved as is to to staff operator reference - Delete after double check[/color][/b][/size]\n\n\n\n\n[u][b]IRC Operator Commands[/b][/u]\n\n[b]OPER[/b]\n Syntax: /OPER userid password\n \n Command to give a user operator status if they match an\n Oper Block\n \n[b]WALLOPS[/b]\n Syntax: /WALLOPS message\n \n Sends a message to all users with umode +w\n \n[b]GLOBOPS[/b]\n Syntax: /GLOBOPS message\n \n Sends a message to all global IRCops\n \n[b]CHATOPS[/b]\n Syntax: /CHATOPS message\n \n Sends a message to all IRCops (local and global)\n \n[b]LOCOPS[/b]\n Syntax: /LOCOPS message\n \n Sends a message to all local IRCops\n \n[b]ADCHAT[/b]\n Syntax: /ADCHAT message\n \n Sends a message to all Admins\n \n[b]NACHAT[/b]\n Syntax: /NACHAT message\n \n Sends a message to all Net Admins\n \n[b]KILL[/b]\n Syntax: /KILL nick reason\n \n Kills a user from the network\n \n[b]KLINE[/b]\n Syntax: /KLINE [+|-]user@host | nick [time to ban reason]\n \n Bans the hostmask from the server it is issued on.

ChanServ can often prevent malicious users from â€œtaking overâ€ channels by limiting who is allowed channel operator privileges. Available commands are listed below; to use them, type [quote]/msg ChanServ command[/quote]. For more information on a specific command, type [quote]/msg ChanServ HELP command[/quote]\n \n[b]REGISTER[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  REGISTER channel password description\n \n Registers a channel in the ChanServ database.  In order\n to use this command, you must first be a channel operator\n on the channel you\'re trying to register.  The password\n is used with the IDENTIFY command to allow others to\n make changes to the channel settings at a later time.\n The last parameter, which must be included, is a\n general description of the channel\'s purpose.\n \n When you register a channel, you are recorded as the\n \"founder\" of the channel.  The channel founder is allowed\n to change all of the channel settings for the channel;\n ChanServ will also automatically give the founder\n channel-operator privileges when s/he enters the channel.\n See the ACCESS command (/msg ChanServ HELP ACCESS) for\n information on giving a subset of these privileges to\n other channel users.\n \n NOTICE: In order to register a channel, you must have\n first registered your nickname.  If you haven\'t,\n /msg ChanServ HELP for information on how to do so.[/quote]\n\n[b]IDENTIFY[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  IDENTIFY channel password\n \n Authenticates you to ChanServ as the founder of the given\n channel.  Many commands require you to use this command\n before using them.  The password should be the same one\n you sent with the REGISTER command.[/quote]\n \n[b]LOGOUT[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  LOGOUT channel nickname\n \n This command will log the selected nickname out meaning they\n would have to reidentify themselves to regain their access.\n \n If you are the founder of the channel, you can log out anybody,\n else you can only log out yourself.[/quote]\n \n[b]DROP[/b]\n[/quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ DROP channel\n \n Unregisters the named channel.  Can only be used by\n channel founder, who must use the IDENTIFY command first.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel option parameters\n \n Allows the channel founder to set various channel options\n and other information.\n \n Available options:\n \n     FOUNDER       Set the founder of a channel\n     SUCCESSOR     Set the successor for a channel\n     PASSWORD      Set the founder password\n     DESC          Set the channel description\n     URL           Associate a URL with the channel\n     EMAIL         Associate an E-mail address with the channel\n     ENTRYMSG      Set a message to be sent to users when they\n                      enter the channel\n     BANTYPE       Set how Services make bans on the channel\n     MLOCK         Lock channel modes on or off\n     KEEPTOPIC     Retain topic when channel is not in use\n     OPNOTICE      Send a notice when OP/DEOP commands are used\n     PEACE         Regulate the use of critical commands\n     PRIVATE       Hide channel from LIST command\n     RESTRICTED    Restrict access to the channel\n     SECURE        Activate ChanServ security features\n     SECUREOPS     Stricter control of chanop status\n     SECUREFOUNDER Stricter control of channel founder status\n     SIGNKICK      Sign kicks that are done with KICK command\n     TOPICLOCK     Topic can only be changed with TOPIC\n     XOP           Toggle the user privilege system\n \n Type /msg ChanServ HELP SET option for more information on a\n particular option.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET FOUNDER[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel FOUNDER nick\n \n Changes the founder of a channel.  The new nickname must\n be a registered one.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET SUCCESSOR[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel SUCCESSOR nick\n \n Changes the successor of a channel.  If the founder\'s\n nickname expires or is dropped while the channel is still\n registered, the successor will become the new founder of the\n channel.  However, if the successor already has too many\n channels registered (<num>), the channel will be dropped\n instead, just as if no successor had been set.  The new\n nickname must be a registered one.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET PASSWORD[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel PASSWORD password\n \n Sets the password used to identify as the founder of the\n channel.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET DESC[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel DESC description\n \n Sets the description for the channel, which shows up with\n the LIST and INFO commands.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET URL[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel URL <url>\n \n Associates the given URL with the channel.

When topic retention is set, the topic for the\n channel will be remembered by ChanServ even after the\n last user leaves the channel, and will be restored the\n next time the channel is created.[/quote]\n\n[b]SET TOPICLOCK[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel TOPICLOCK {ON | OFF}\n \n Enables or disables the topic lock option for a channel.\n When topic lock is set, ChanServ will not allow the\n channel topic to be changed except via the TOPIC\n command.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET MLOCK[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel MLOCK modes\n \n Sets the mode-lock parameter for the channel. ChanServ\n allows you to define certain channel modes to be always\n on, off or free to be either on or off.\n \n The modes parameter is constructed exactly the same way\n as a /MODE command; that is, modes followed by a + are\n locked on, and modes followed by a - are locked off. Note,\n however, that unlike the /MODE command, each use of\n SET MLOCK will remove all modes previously locked before\n setting the new!\n \n Warning:  If you set a mode-locked key, as in the second\n example below, you should also set the RESTRICTED option for\n the channel (see HELP SET RESTRICTED), or anyone entering\n the channel when it is empty will be able to see the key!\n \n Examples:\n \n     SET #channel MLOCK +nt-iklps\n         Forces modes n and t on, and modes i, k, l, p, and\n         s off.  Mode m is left free to be either on or off.\n \n     SET #channel MLOCK +knst-ilmp my-key\n         Forces modes k, n, s, and t on, and modes i, l, m,\n         and p off.  Also forces the channel key to be\n         \"my-key\".\n \n     SET #channel MLOCK +\n         Removes the mode lock; all channel modes are free\n         to be either on or off.\n		 [/quote]\n[b]SET PEACE[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel PEACE {ON | OFF}\n \n Enables or disables the peace option for a channel.\n When peace is set, an user won\'t be able to kick,\n ban or remove a channel status of an user that has\n a level superior or equal to his via ChanServ commands.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET PRIVATE[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel PRIVATE {ON | OFF}\n \n Enables or disables the private option for a channel.\n When private is set, a /msg ChanServ LIST will not\n include the channel in any lists.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET RESTRICTED[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel RESTRICTED {ON | OFF}\n \n Enables or disables the restricted access option for a\n channel.

When SIGNKICK is set, kicks issued with\n ChanServ KICK command will have the nick that used the\n command in their reason.\n \n If you use LEVEL, those who have a level that is superior\n or equal to the SIGNKICK level on the channel won\'t have their\n kicks signed. See /msg ChanServ HELP LEVELS for more information.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET XOP[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel XOP {ON | OFF}\n \n Enables or disables the xOP lists system for a channel.\n When XOP is set, you have to use the AOP/SOP/VOP\n commands in order to give channel privileges to\n users, else you have to use the ACCESS command.\n \n Technical Note: when you switch from access list to xOP\n lists system, your level definitions and user levels will be\n changed, so you won\'t find the same values if you\n switch back to access system!\n \n You should also check that your users are in the good xOP\n list after the switch from access to xOP lists, because the\n guess is not always perfect... in fact, it is not recommended\n to use the xOP lists if you changed level definitions with\n the LEVELS command.\n \n Switching from xOP lists system to access list system\n causes no problem though.[/quote]\n \n[b]SET OPNOTICE[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel OPNOTICE {ON | OFF}\n \n Enables or disables the op-notice option for a channel.\n When op-notice is set, ChanServ will send a notice to the\n channel whenever the OP or DEOP commands are used for a user\n in the channel.[/quote]\n \n[b]AOP[/b]\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  AOP channel ADD nick\n         AOP channel DEL {nick | entry-num | list}\n         AOP channel LIST [mask | list]\n         AOP channel CLEAR\n \n Maintains the AOP (AutoOP) list for a channel.

Run from your shell:\n\n[quote]irssi[/quote]\nYou should now see Irssi in its default stateâ€“disconnected, with some blue bars at the top and bottom.\n\nIn Irssi, there are three important connection-related commands: /server, /connect, and /disconnect. Irssi can handle multiple IRC connections simultaneously, thus it is possible to be active in channels on different networks at the same time. The first command, /server, will connect to the specified server on the current network. On the other hand, /connect will open a new network connection and connect to the specified server on the new network.\n\nFor example, typing /connect irc.foo.com will open a new network connection and connect to irc.foo.com. If you then type /connect irc.bar.com, there will be two network connections open, one for irc.foo.com, one for irc.bar.com. Typing /server irc.baz.com while the network connection for irc.bar.com is active will disconnect the client from irc.bar.com and connect to irc.baz.com on that network connection. You can use Ctrl-X to switch between network connections. You can see what the active network is by looking at the status bar, which looks something like this:\n\n[align=center][img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3012235/static/irssi_connect.PNG[/img][/align]\n\n(05:23:10) (irssi-test[+Tiwxz]) (1:SilentZombies (change with ^X))\n\nAt this point you should have a just-opened instance of Irssi, with no connections to any server. Connect to an IRC server by typing:\n\n[quote]/connect -ssl irc.digitalwizardry.org 6697[/quote]\n\nand change your nickname with:\n\n[quote]/nick [you][/quote]\n\nIf everything connected fine, join a channel by typing:\n\n[quote]/join #empornium[/quote]\n\n[align=center][img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3012235/static/irssi_channel_join.PNG[/img][/align]\n\n[b]Switching Windows[/b]\n\nYou should now notice that the â€œstatusâ€ window is now hidden, and youâ€™re looking at the channel you just joined. You should also notice that your status bar says â€œ2:#emporniumâ€. This means that the window for #empornium is assigned window number 2. The status window is by default window number 1. To switch between windows in Irssi, use Alt-#, where # is 0-9. Windows start at number 1, and Alt-0 goes to window number 10. You can use Alt-q through Alt-o for windows 11 to 19. It is possible to have more than 19 windows. Use Alt with the arrow keys to scroll through the windows.\n\nTip: If youâ€™re trying to get to end windows past 19, start at window 1, and then use Alt with the left arrow key.\n\nAdvanced note: use /help bind to learn about the /bind command. It can be used to assign keyboard shortcuts to windows past 19.\n\nTo get support for auto-identifying you to nickserv you will need to get an external plugin for irssi:[url=http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/nickserv.pl]http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/nickserv.pl[/url]. Adding and managing plugins is beyond the scope of this tutorial but there are guides on how to do it on the IRSSI website.',70679,'2012-09-10 21:12:17'),(45060,5811,129045,'2012-07-25 15:19:07',':hmmm:\r\n\r\nOdd, it should behave the same as the Cover area on Uploads.\r\n\r\nThis really needs some fixin\'\r\n\r\n[b]EDIT:[/b] [b]Workarounds[/b]\r\n\r\nhttp://empornium.mooo.com/requests.php?action=view&id=15\r\n\r\nRight click over the fullsize image in xxx.freeimage.us and copy its address\\link\\url\r\n\r\nThe resulting URL should contain xxx.freeimage.us[color=#FF0000]/image.php[/color], ignore thumb.php and share.php they will not work with this method.\r\n\r\ne.g. xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=XXXX_00000000\r\n\r\nEdit the URL replacing [color=#FF0000].php?id=[/color] with a hyphen [color=#FF0000]-[/color] and then append [color=#FF0000].jpg[/color]:     xxx.freeimage.us/image[color=#FF0000]-[/color]XXXX_00000000[color=#FF0000].jpg[/color]\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nSimply append [color=#FF0000]&.jpg[/color] to the link:     xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=XXXX_00000000[color=#FF0000]&.jpg[/color]',129045,'2012-07-25 19:44:37'),(45061,5802,84499,'2012-07-25 15:30:33','\r\n\r\nI dunno, it dosent do anything malicious afaik - just looks fucked up.

Its a web site, owned and run. Not a democracy. Now the site staff seem quite happy to listen and try to accommodate as much as possible or reasonable given many variables. Such as, time, effort, popular opinion, etc. Thats pretty good of them, they dont have to.\n\nUnderstand this, tags nearly didnt exist at all. The staff have their reasons for that, and their reasons why they do exist anyway. Either answer was going to upset some people, damned if they do, damned if they dont. I dont know which staff supported them, and which dont but its not the point.\n\nBut the end result was not to mandate any tags, just offer them as an option and code the site to use them. While that in itself leaves some room for tags to be less effective, they make up for that with community tagging. Perfect to someone who likes tags?, probably not. But a good compromise it is.\n\nThats my take on it anyway. Im not privy to inner circle discussion, but Ive gleaned that much.\n\n\n\nPost pics of the ladies?

Like giving medals for torrents posted, 1 or 5 torrents gives the first medal and then it can expand with stars when more torrents are posted or some other simple feature. And likewise with forum post, maybe a request medal (for filling requests) and so on. Collage medal, tagging medal and so on. So you can have that one guy that always add tags to stuff who gets a super tagging master bling medal for his effort, or a super poster that get a medal for his and so on. Ofc you can have a seeding medal that is bound to the earned bonus points and it would represent a good seeder. And ofc a medal for those who takes the time to write thanks. =)\r\n\r\nThis is just an idea im trowing out there regarding the bling. Seems a lot more fun that way, atleast to me.

It contains some basic guidelines to testing and bug hunting aswell as some things that we already found. If you think that this guide is not complete or if it is incorrect please send me a PM or reply in this thread.\n\n[size=3][b]How to submit a bug report[/b][/size]\n\nLet\'s start with the most important information first. What do do when you find a bug. \n\nTo tell us about it we need specific information:\n\n\nNow for some simple guidelines when you want to share you bug with the coders.\n \n[*]Search the forum to see if the bug is already known.\n[*]If the bug is indeed new then start a new topic. As a topic name please use following: Location - Desription of bug. With location I mean things like [Forum] or [Torrent Details]. Example: [Torrent Upload] - My cover image is not accepted.\n[*]Fill the topic with as much information as you possibly can. Use images if it is hard to describe what is happening. Be sure to atleast give the information as noted in the following 3 bullets.\n[*][b]The page url[/b] For example the url for the browse torrents page is [code]http://empornium.mooo.com/torrents.php[/code] which when written in a post becomes: http://empornium.mooo.com/torrents.php\n[*][b]What is wrong[/b] Tell us what the problem is, and if applicable the way you expect it to work.\n[*][b]How to reproduce it[/b] Please include enough information so that we can reproduce the bug ourselves. Reproduce it yourself first if possible, and make a note of what actions produce the bug.\n[*]Keep track of your topic (potentially subscribe to it). Coders might require additional information or another tester might want to do additional tests working together with you.\n \n[size=3][b]How to hunt for bugs[/b][/size]\n \nThere is no set way in which one can hunt for a bug. The reason for this is that no one knows where the bugs are located. There are however a few simple pointers that you can follow while hunting:\n \n[*][b]Work systematically[/b] In other words don\'t go clicking haphazardly because that way it is almost impossible to reproduce what you did when things go wrong.\n[*][b]Test things multiple times[/b] A result could always be a fluke. This goes for both bugs and correct functionality. If you test something several times and the same thing always happens then you either have a bug that you can reproduce or you have correct behaviour that you can vouch for.\n[*][b]Test again at a later time[/b] Some bugs are easy to fix, others are a lot more complicated. To ensure that a bug is truly gone or that an old bug doesn\'t reappear it is always advisable to test features again a week later and yet again the next week. It would suck if 2 weeks after going live a bug reappears because it  is date triggered and happens every 2 weeks or something.\n[*][b]Don\'t assume anything[/b] As they say: \"Assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups\". If you think something works then please make sure that it does.\n \n \nPlease note that this list probably is not complete and is therefor subject to change. Take a look every once in a while to see if there were changes. Who knows the uploaders might have noticed that a certain step is not neccessary and you are still doing all that work for nothing! \n\n\n\n[size=3][b]End of guide so far.[/b][/size]\nOk this was just to get the ball rolling.

Another could search for [b]\"Sensi Pearl\"[/b] and add the tags [b]sensi.pearl cassie.nelson tiny.tits petite brunette flexible brown.eyes[/b]\n\nA mod could search for [b]FTV[/b] and remove the tag [b]amateur[/b], or search for the user [b]ImaVandal[/b] and remove the tags [b]sucky.video this.is.shit more.boobs uploader.is.gay[/b]\n[/quote] \n\nThe current tag voting system should be enough to prevent widespread abuse of the add feature (the staff can decide what user ranks should have access to it), and the remove feature will make the job of moderating tags much easier on the staff, any time they get a report of a bad tag they can search where else it was used and remove them all at once. \n',49532,'2012-08-03 01:17:17'),(45830,5911,49532,'2012-08-03 01:36:01','add  :ridicule: to their profile for 24 hrs  :laugh: \r\n\r\n:smartass:',NULL,NULL),(45831,5912,37338,'2012-08-03 04:25:46','Problem: When selecting the doubleseed button unexpected error pops up\r\n\r\nWhat I did: I tired it on all torrents and they are all popping this message up.\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=7ACA_501B36DB][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=7ACA_501B36DB&jpg[/img][/url]',NULL,NULL),(45832,5875,37338,'2012-08-03 04:27:24','2.2.1 seems to be working fine.

This could also be used to add other tags like teen, english, brunette, tattoos.\r\n\r\nThis system could also be used to get similar tags to be renamed. Like some users add double.penetration while other add dp, this system could change dp to double.penetration or double.penetration to dp. and all the tags would be in the same kind of system and also a lot easier for the users to find what they are looking for. It could be used to change misspelled names and other stuff also.\r\n\r\nAnd some longer toughs...\r\n\r\nSo it would work like this, borrowing the post example from apparition\r\nSomeone would add sensi.pearl and/or sensipearl, this would be a \"actor\" tag in the database, another \"actor\" tag in the same post would be cassie.nelson and cassienelson for example. These would have \"trigger\" tags that could be teen, brunette, petite, flexible, brown.eyes, and also adding the main tags cassie.nelson and sensi.pearl if one of them were missing.\r\n\r\nSo adding cassie.nelson would auto add sensi.pearl, petite, brunette, flexible, brown.eyes, teen.\r\nThis tagging system could also be parsed in the old databases, some users could add stuff and create new tag auto systems that would auto parse emp and add and change tags. This would ofc be a problem with actors that\'s been in the game for a long time, and some description tags would be strange.\r\n\r\nExampel rebecca.liniares after boobjob and before boobjob would require different tags. So this system has to be a little bit interesting to get it to work. (but as an old database programmer i just think its sound fun) you need to keep track of the tags changed and also be able to remove and change those tags. So the system could have some problems that needs tuning and some separate stuff that keeps track of tags changed, so it can change those tags back if they don\'t get votes in the voting system. (great explanation from me) But the system could with no problem add stuff that doesn\'t change like brunette, flexible, brown.eyed, latino, russian, english and so on. If the system keeps track of the changes it make it would also be easy to restore of someone does a mistake or something.\r\n\r\nSo the rebecca.liniares example after her boobjob, someone would go in to the database and remove small.tits from rebecca.liniares, the script would then parse and remove all small.tits added by the program regarding this actor, unless someone voted for the small tits or added them in any other way (or they got auto added regarding another girl in threesome scene with another actor with small tits, or in a collection or movie)\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure about all the stuff in this, but the actor name stuff could be useful and the renaming of similar tags would also help. But in a siterip there would be a lot of tags. I don\'t know if that\'s good or bad, most of them will be similar anyways.',NULL,NULL),(45834,5875,86439,'2012-08-03 05:52:39','uTorrent 2.2.1',NULL,NULL),(45835,5912,86439,'2012-08-03 06:02:54','Confirmed.

You can just search  for brea.benet, click the select all check box  put brea.benet in the remove field, and brea.bennett in the add field.  Hit the submit button and your done.\n\nEven better, also have bulk synonym replacement:  search  for brea.benet, click the select all check box  put brea.benet in the synonym field, and brea.bennett in the maintag field.  Hit the submit button and all instances of brea.benet are replaced with brea.bennett, and brea.benet is added to the synonyms, so it will be replaced on each additional attempt to add it.\n\nNow consider how it is now, mods have to select each torrent one at a time, delete brea.benet, add brea.bennett, the go to the next torrent, and do it again 100 times.

But the method which you are suggesting is not the best way to do things.  I am not going to get into the details here but there are far more efficient ways of doing what you suggest.\r\n\r\nWhen Lanz is ready to think about a cheat script he knows where to find me LOL.  It is really pretty simple to have a simple one.  The one we have at PB is very very sophisticated and judging from the explanations we get for people cheating it is far more sophisticated than other sites use (because users are surprised when we say . . . that explanation is totally bogus or we have even had users say \"but they bought that excuse on my 3 or 5 or whatever other sites\" and we say well our data says otherwise).\r\n\r\nHonestly the less people know about the details of a cheat detection script the better.  I will say that there are features built into the new PB that were only implemented to help detect cheaters.  I do not see the need to do that here but those are things that I can explain to Lanz and he can make the final decision.\r\n\r\nEven without the specific features of the site that makes things easier there are pretty easy simple ways to catch the buggers.  The bottom line is that the more data you have the better.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is that going over the cheat reports is a very very daunting task.  Even with all of the sophistication of the system we have at PB it generally takes about 5 minutes per new report to confirm or deny a cheat.  Again I am glad to help Lanz with the design of the script and once that is sorted I am glad to help teach all of the staff here how to interpret the data . . . but it is going to be a lot of extra work for staff.  On a closed site like PB where we get something like 5 or 10 new members a week at the most and we have ways of eliminating many of the false positives it still takes about an hour a day to go over the new cheats every day.  When there is a back log (like from me being on vacation) it can easily take 10 or 12 days of 2 hours a day to get caught back up.\r\n\r\nIf it sounds like I am trying to scare you all . . . that is because I am.  You need everyone pitching in to keep on top of cheaters.  It will make the site a much better place but it really is a huge amount of work.  The nice part about open signups is that there is always an influx of new users who are potential staffers so that helps.  The downside is that a lot of users are far more likely to cheat because they know that a new account is just a new IP address and e-mail address away.  When you start banning folks you will start getting folks from the cheating boards who will sign up for an account just to test the settings of the cheat script to find out the settings/boundaries and report back to their mates.  It really is a battle.  But let us face it the point on an open invite site is to eliminate the casual cheater.  The really sophisticated cheaters are very very hard to catch and quite frankly on an open invite site they are not worth going after . . . they all have VPN\'s and boatloads of e-mail addresses the only thing you can do to those folks is to keep squashing them like bugs until they get bored/frustrated signing up for a new account every few days/weeks/months.\r\n\r\nAgain when Lanz is ready I will give him a brain dump of the features required to make the job easier.  Those scripts that you linked are a good starting point but honestly they are lacking a lot of important features.  Using a canned script that is publicly available is ok for a small closed site but they will just not work for a site of this size without burning out staff at an astounding rate.',NULL,NULL),(45901,5744,51063,'2012-08-03 20:16:40','[quote=eimaimpala][quote=mifune]\r\n\r\nSay hi and ask any questions you have here.\r\n\r\nI can answer the first one... \r\n\r\nQ: what do FLS do?\r\nA: we dont know yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n:lol:[/quote]\r\n\r\nWell, this kinda sums up the whole thing doesn\'t it? :laugh:\r\nFrom my private tracker experience so far, \r\nFirst Line Support is volunteering to answer PM\'s about stuff, to ease the staff\'s load of work.\r\nFrom software stuff and coding, to simpler stuff like ripping, uploading, where to find covers etc. And other stuff, that people don\'t want to post in the forums, but isn\'t that important to bother a staff member.\r\n\r\nAs for access to staff messages and resolving reports, I don\'t know.

Honestly I love the idea of getting paid to staff a site (God knows I have put a boatload of hours into staffing torrent sites) however, it opens up a very bad legal precedent.\r\n\r\nWhen staff can say \"I am not making any profit by doing this (running a site)\" it is very hard for staff to get sued by copyright holders.  When staff is getting paid and profits are very well known by the general membership that is when sites get into trouble.  It is my very informed opinion that is why the old Emp and TnA were targets as well as C! . . . simply because it was very obvious those sites were making lots of money.  As I have said elsewhere that is not a model you want to follow.\r\n\r\nI have no problem donating my time to run the sites I currently and formerly have staffed.  I for one do not want to risk getting sued by some DCMA nazi because I am making $50 a month or whatever to staff that site.  Yeah If I was getting paid a living wage that would be great . . . but let us face is that is not going to happen -- that being the case it is just not worth the risk to me.  There is no reason to make this site a target by paying staffers.  That is very obviously one of the things that C! in particular did very wrong and when C! went under it led to a lot of posturing and bad blood between the site owner and the very well compensated Admin who was actually running the site.\r\n\r\nI can not speak for anyone else but that is not why I do what I do on torrent sites.  I really do not want to get into arguments over pay and who contributes more hours and whose work is more valuable and all of that nonsense.  I personally got enough of that crap when I was a hiring manager in corporate America.  I do not need my hobby to generate that kind of aggravation especially for very little money -- if we were talking about staffers getting 20,000 a year or something that would be worth the risk but for 5,000 a year totally not worth the risk to me.',NULL,NULL),(45924,5706,51063,'2012-08-03 21:47:24','I have to admit that I love this feature that many other sites have.

This is going to sound arrogant and that is far from my intent but it is what it is.\r\n\r\nI am a fairly highly visible torrent user.  In general I use the same user name everywhere I am an Admin on one site and I was a very visible staffer on another huge site (the old emp) I was a member of the \"board of directors\" of another very popular torrent/file sharing discussion site.  I am not trying to brag here I just love torrenting and I do not make much of an effort to hide it.  However, uploading is different.  The vast majority of legal action has come against uploaders and site Admins and owners.  Maybe my paranoia and delusions of grandeur are out of place but it is my opinion that I am exactly the type of person who the MPAA and DCMA would love to bust and then put me on a plinth and say see this is what we do to file sharers.\r\n\r\nAs a result I prefer my uploads to completely anonymous.  There are other options of course . . . like allowing paranoid users to have two accounts or what I am currently doing when I upload to .me . . . clearly stating that I am just passing on what I have found from other sites and that I am not the person who ripped the content.\r\n\r\nYes I could suck it up and pay the $10 a month and get a good VPN but as we all know if someone really wants to find out who you are all of those VPN\'s require a copy of your drivers license or a copy of a utility bill or more so they are not as anonymous as some think.  Yes there are steps you can take to make it harder to get identified but nothing is fool proof.\r\n\r\nYes an anonymous upload does not protect me completely but it does keep the baddies from seeing that the one upload they are picking on is only one of 100 or whatever the number is.  That is a degree of protection I know that I enjoy.  I just do not want the baddies to be able to say . . . hey we are going after this guy and he has over 100 uploads.  Let us try to get all of the producers of that content in on this [legal action].\r\n\r\nI know it is a lot of work and it requires a lot of testing but to me personally it is worth it.  Of course I travel in circles where folks love anonymous uploads; but, like attracts like so that is not exactly surprising.  So I do know lots and lots of folks who will only upload when they can do so anonymously -- but that very well might be because I know almost all of the folks who think that way.\r\n\r\nAs far as who can see them . . . if I mark an upload as anonymous I for one think only full staff (meaning all staff except FLS) should be able to see the uploaders user name.  I do not want some Pimp or Sextreme or whatever to be able to see it just because they have uploaded a lot.  There is not inherent security in someone being a Sextreme or whatever not being a baddie . . . especially when that title is automatically conferred based on number of torrents uploaded.\r\n\r\nAlso if you are going to implement anonymous uploads please make sure that when the uploader comments on their own anonymous upload that the comment is anonymous as well ;-)  Just because I want to upload anonymously does not mean that I do not want to interact with the people who comment on my uploads.',NULL,NULL),(46041,5635,1243,'2012-08-04 21:06:05','nope\n\nhmm, pm is obviously broken for some reason...\n\npm\'s should work again.',1243,'2012-08-04 21:34:41'),(46042,5854,51063,'2012-08-04 21:06:31','LOL that is a good question.

I catch users on PB all the time . . . some of whom have been on the site for over 4 years . . . and that is on a closed invite-only site where invites are given out to most users at a rate of 1 per month . . . and only then when the user requests an invite (so 99.9% of users only get one invite at a time per month) and if you already have one from the previous month you do not get another LOL.  The point being that when you cheat on a site that gives out invites very sparingly you know that if you get caught once you are pretty much gone forever.  Where as on an open invite site a new account is just a new IP address and new e-mail address a day.\r\n\r\nWhen PB was open invite . . . oye fucking vey . . . I was banning about 3 to 5 users a day.  And that was using a very unsophisticated cheat script.  If we had the script we have on the new site when we were open invites that number probably would be double -- if not triple.\r\n\r\nI just caught a guy last night on .me who Clownius told me had never legitimate uploaded anything!  He had been on the site for like 4 months.  I only caught him because he was stupid enough to cheat on a torrent I had uploaded and I happened to hit the refresh button at the right instance.\r\n\r\nTrust me you have boatloads of cheaters.\r\n\r\nAs far as mifune\'s statement . . . it is very valid especially on an open invite site.  However, with the IP history features of gazelle it really is easier to keep the cheaters out.  That IP history is a huge bonus in trying to eliminate cheaters.  You can do a simple search and find multiple accounts much easier than on TBDev.  Also everyone who is examining cheat reports needs to be able to ban IP addresses.  But it is still like trying to bail out your canoe with a thimble.  But if you keep on top of it . . . eventually the cheaters will go somewhere else where they do not have to create a new account every few days.  It takes a lot of work but it does eventually pay off.  Word gets out that site XXX bans cheaters without mercy and that you are better off cheating elsewhere and then the cheats do start to die off.  But that takes about 6 to 10 months LOL\r\n\r\nThe point is that cheaters are by definition bad users that are doing nothing at all for your torrent site except boosting upload totals for the legitimate users.  They never participate in the forums, they never say thanks for the upload, they do not comment . . . they just grab whatever they want and then they bugger off.\r\n\r\nI can not tell you how many users I have banned for cheating with more than 3 forum posts or torrent comments combined but the number is very very close to zero LOL.\r\n\r\nThey are like ticks (or leeches or pick the blood sucking insect of your choice).  So yeah getting rid of as many as possible is worth while.  But as mifune implied detecting say 90% of them is a reasonable goal.  To get rid of that last 10% will take more time and effort than getting rid of the first 90% -- these numbers are just examples do not take these as gospel.  There is a point of diminishing returns.  This is very common in the programming world . . . getting say a 90% solution is fairly easy but getting that last 10% often takes more than double the effort in design and programming and then effort to analyze the data.\r\n\r\nWhen Lanz or mifune are ready I expect we can get a cheat script and data presentation system cobbled together in about a regular working day or more likely a few hours  (if you want to look at a worst case scenario we can even call it 3 8 hour days but I can not imagine it will take that long).  It will then probably take about a week or so to teach everyone how to interpret the common issues with analyzing the cheat reports.  At which point on a site this size I would guesstimate there will probably be about 2 hours of work a day dealing with the reports.  After about 6 weeks that time will probably fall to about 1 hour a day at which time interpreting the data will be more innate and everyone will no longer be thinking . . . what do I do next?\r\n\r\nSo is all that worth the effort . . . I honestly do not know the answer to that and let us face it . . . we will not know for sure until we start the process if my numbers are even close to accurate.  LOL\r\n\r\nBut that is my best estimate so that is probably what we should base the discussion on.',NULL,NULL),(46055,5854,1507,'2012-08-05 00:51:59','[quote=Lanz]Yeah the mod tool goes up to 1 week, lets see how long it takes usb to give one out once we go live :laugh:[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n:laugh: :laugh: :laugh:\r\n\r\n :yes2: ',NULL,NULL),(46056,5744,51063,'2012-08-05 00:56:21','LOL google translate wrote in German LOL I wrote in English LOL\n\nAnd it was a quote from that episode of Fawlty Towers.',51063,'2012-08-05 00:56:56'),(46059,5635,1507,'2012-08-05 01:05:22','[quote=apparition][quote=Lanz]So they don\'t have a limit for the number of golds one can earn per hour then?[/quote]\r\nI don\'t think they have a limit, but I could be wrong.

So if you mess up you do not show your password in the channel for all to see!![/color]\n\nSo first make sure you are using the nickname you want. if not you can change it with:\n\n[b]/nick <nickname>[/b]\n\nexample : /nick barumba_is_the_man\n\nThen register your nickname:\n\n[b]/ns register <password> <email>[/b]\n\nexample: /ns register empircisfun barumba@gmail.com\n\nmake sure you use a password you remember!\nyou will not get an email notifications. This will only be used to recover your password. \nOnce given that command you are done. And you need to do it only once.\nIf you mess up contact the staff and they can help you fix it.\n\n\n[b]1. Using the Webchat[/b] -> [color=#FF0000]not to state the obvious but.... you will make your life a LOT LOT LOT easier using a client instead.[/color]\n\nWith this option all you have to do is identify yourself in the [b]status window[/b]:\n\n[b]/ns identify <password>[/b]\n\nexample: /ns identify empircisfun\n\nthen use the [b]/join[/b] command in the [b]status window[/b]:\n\n/join #empornium-staff\n\nyou can do this manually but with the new webchat interface you can have it done for you.\n\nFirst you select the channel(s) you want to join:\n\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=CC57_504BE3AA[/img]\n\nThen you select the Auth pull-down menu and input your password:\n\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=4293_504BE3AA[/img]\n\n\n\n[b]2. Using mIRC[/b]\n\nIf you are not familiar with mIRC after getting it and installing it read the guide (no point in duplicating it, is good) : [url=http://www.mirc.com/install.html]Link to first use guide[/url]\n\nThe to connect to the staff channel you need to enable SSL in mIRC.\n\nGet and install OpenSSL 1.0.1c from here: [url=http://www.mirc.com/downloads/openssl/openssl-1.0.1c-setup.exe]openssl-1.0.1c-setup.exe[/url]\n\nLet it install in your System32 folder. Is OK this way SSL is available to all of your applications if needed. Including mIRC. You will see that mIRC is SSL enabled now going to [b]Tools [/b]then [b]Options [/b]and choosing [b]Options [/b]under [b]Connect[/b] and you will see the [b]SSL [/b]button is active (not grey anymore.\n\nClick it and in the windows from the pull down menu select [b]accept invalid certificates automatically[/b].\n\nThe add the empornium server like in the image below:\n\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=8DA7_50267CD4[/img]\n\nnotice the port is +6697. This is very important for all to work\n\nThen after you connect to the server and identify yourself you can access the staff forum with the /join command and then you can add it to your favorites, make it auto join, etc... as you like.\n\nThen in mIRC you can automate the identify. So you do not have to worry about it anymore.\n\nsimply go to [b]Tools [/b]then [b]Script Editor...[/b] and select the [b]Remote [/b]tab is is not.\n\nThen copy/paste this text in the window:\n\n[color=#0000FF]on 1:NOTICE:*This nickname is registered and protected*:?: {\n  if ($nick == NickServ) {\n    ns identify PASSWORD\n  }\n}\n\non 1:NOTICE:*This nick is owned by someone else*:?: {\n  if ($nick == NickServ) {\n    ns identify PASSWORD\n  }\n}[/color]\n\nand change the two instances of PASSWORD to yours. Click OK and you are done!\n\n[b]3. Using Chatzilla[/b] \n\nChatzilla is a Firefox plug-in so it works on any OS where Firefox can be installed. You install it like any other plug-in and access it from the tools window. Then to access the Empornium IRC server type:\n\n/sslserver irc.emprn.tk 6697\n\nWhen you connect you will be warned that the server has an invalid certificate, click \"add exeption\" and remember to change your nickname to the one you use on the site and identify yourself. Then use the /join command.\n\nYou can automate the identification in Chatzilla preferences see below:\n\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=F16A_50269083[/img]\n\nand you can add channels for an auto-join when you start Chatzilla right click the channel tab and do as below:\n\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=8B09_5026A1EF[/img]\n\n[b]4. XChat (thanks MrRandom for this)[/b]\n\nHow to connect with xchat (this tutorial also works for clients based off of xchat such as HexChat)\n\nFirstly we need to get xchat installed. For linux users it should be in your repository e.g. ubuntu is \"sudo apt-get install xchat\". If you are on windows you can grab it from [url=http://www.silverex.org/download/]here[/url].\n\nWhen you first run xchat you will be presented with a server connect list.\n\n[img]http://xchat.org/docs/start/xchat-1-servlist.png[/img]\n\nChange your nickname and real name settings. Then click add to add a new IRC network and change the name to \"Empornium IRC\" and hit enter.\n\n[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3012235/static/xchat_server_edit.PNG[/img]\n\nClick edit double click on \"newserver/6667\" and change it to \"irc.digitalwizardry.org/6697\", [color=#FF0000]once edited click somewhere else or it will not be saved![/color] Click the check boxes on Use SSL and Accept invalid SSL Certificate, and if you registered your nickname enter the password you used.\n\n[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3012235/static/xchat_server_edit2.PNG[/img]\n\nClick the close button, then click connect and that\'s you you should be connected to Empornium IRC over secure SSL.\n\n\n\n\n[u][url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients]Here[/url][/u] you can find a very nice comparative list of the IRC clients available with lots of information.\n\nIf you decide to use one different than the ones mentioned make sure that it does support SSL otherwise you cannot enter the staff channel.',70679,'2012-09-09 00:34:17'),(46616,5967,1507,'2012-08-11 14:07:01',' :panic:  :panic:  :panic: \r\n\r\n[b]no forums, means no Contest thread, means no more freebies to give away....   :panic:  :panic:  :panic: \r\n\r\nwhat will I ever do....???\r\n\r\nusb[/b]\r\n\r\n:laugh:\r\n\r\n:usb:',NULL,NULL),(46617,5982,75827,'2012-08-11 15:02:02','Hi, i have tried the notifications system, Last night i made a filter list with these tags,\n\nHardcore teen fisting fetish\n\nNone of these Tags: fake.tits\n\nand pick a few categories to match: Teen Natural Tits Fetish Megapack\n\nBut when i check it today there was still nothing added to my Notification list, even if there was a torrent posted with the Hardcore tag in it. { [color=#CC6600]Just notice all the torrents are few days old so this might be why they din`t get added All still post some small torrents with corresponding tags to see if it works[/color]}\n\nToday i will post some torrent with the same tags as i used in my filter to see if the system will pick up.

It contains some basic guidelines to testing and bug hunting aswell as some things that we already found. If you think that this guide is not complete or if it is incorrect please send me a PM or reply in this thread.\n\n[size=3][b]How to submit a bug report[/b][/size]\n\nLet\'s start with the most important information first. What do do when you find a bug. \n\nTo tell us about it we need specific information:\n\n\nNow for some simple guidelines when you want to share you bug with the coders.\n \n[*]Search the forum to see if the bug is already known.\n[*]If the bug is indeed new then start a new topic. As a topic name please use following: Location - Desription of bug. With location I mean things like [Forum] or [Torrent Details]. Example: [Torrent Upload] - My cover image is not accepted.\n[*]Fill the topic with as much information as you possibly can. Use images if it is hard to describe what is happening. Be sure to atleast give the information as noted in the following 3 bullets.\n[*][b]The page url[/b] For example the url for the browse torrents page is [code]http://empornium.mooo.com/torrents.php[/code] which when written in a post becomes: http://empornium.mooo.com/torrents.php\n[*][b]What is wrong[/b] Tell us what the problem is, and if applicable the way you expect it to work.\n[*][b]How to reproduce it[/b] Please include enough information so that we can reproduce the bug ourselves. Reproduce it yourself first if possible, and make a note of what actions produce the bug.\n[*]Keep track of your topic (potentially subscribe to it). Coders might require additional information or another tester might want to do additional tests working together with you.\n \n[size=3][b]How to hunt for bugs[/b][/size]\n \nThere is no set way in which one can hunt for a bug. The reason for this is that no one knows where the bugs are located. There are however a few simple pointers that you can follow while hunting:\n \n[*][b]Work systematically[/b] In other words don\'t go clicking haphazardly because that way it is almost impossible to reproduce what you did when things go wrong.\n[*][b]Test things multiple times[/b] A result could always be a fluke. This goes for both bugs and correct functionality. If you test something several times and the same thing always happens then you either have a bug that you can reproduce or you have correct behaviour that you can vouch for.\n[*][b]Test again at a later time[/b] Some bugs are easy to fix, others are a lot more complicated. To ensure that a bug is truly gone or that an old bug doesn\'t reappear it is always advisable to test features again a week later and yet again the next week. It would suck if 2 weeks after going live a bug reappears because it  is date triggered and happens every 2 weeks or something.\n[*][b]Don\'t assume anything[/b] As they say: \"Assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups\". If you think something works then please make sure that it does.\n \n \nPlease note that this list probably is not complete and is therefor subject to change. Take a look every once in a while to see if there were changes. Who knows the coders might have noticed that a certain step is not neccessary and you are still doing all that work for nothing!

The reason for it being marked will be clear on the torrent page.  If any user chooses to download a marked torrent any lost ratio etc. is on that users head.  It is a gamble if the users chooses to take that gamble and it fails so be it . . . do not come whining to staff about ratio issues arising from downloading torrents marked for deletion.\n\nIf you are the uploader and you want to fix the torrent visit the torrent page and edit the torrent when you are done click on the \"If you have fixed this upload make sure you have told the staff: By clicking here\" link (and then the yes you are sure prompt). This will notify staff you have fixed your torrent. Once staff have reviewed your changes we will either re-mark the torrent for deletion (if the changes were not adequate) or we will mark the torrent as ok. \n\nNote: Torrents will not be deleted if they are waiting for a staff member to review your changes (as long as you clicked the button on the page) but you get 24 hours total to fix your torrent [b]including rejects[/b] - IOW if your fix is rejected you get no time extension... for this reason alone you should make sure you fix your torrent asap just in case the fix is rejected and you need to fix it again! (but also it will get more peers if it is fixed more quickly).\n\n \n[#=badges]Badges/medals[/#]\n\nThese show how much a member has contributed to the site.

After this if you need a post edited for some reason report the post and explain your reason.\n\nThere is a 10 second flood control on posting in the forums and comments, this is mainly to prevent spam/double click double posts but is hopefully a short enough span that it will not be too much inconvenience.\n\n\n[#=notifications]Notifications[/#]\n\n[size=4][b][color=#FF0000]<<insert content>>[/color][/b][/size]\n\n\n[#=inactive]Inactive Users[/#]\n\n[b]User Reaper[/b] - after 4 months of no activity (no login) your account will be diabled.

[url=http://css-tricks.com/css-image-replacement/]http://css-tricks.com/css-image-replacement/[/url]\r\n\r\nSo this would be a good exercise for custom css-builders. \r\n\r\nAs for icons good icons should be self-evident and not tied to a specific operating system. However using familiar icons would lessen any learning curve. But for instance which operating system has a standard icon for download? To my knowledge not one. \r\n\r\nAs for the five icons presented by Hexensabbat they are quite recognisable for any windows user, but that don\'t make them good.\r\n\r\nThis isn\'t a value judgement towards Hexen nor windows just a deconstruction of how icons can be missunderstood or outright bad. \r\nFirst icon - Edit icon? I see a representation for a (written) document.\r\nSecond icon - Bookmark? This is one of the worst icons in Windows history, the favourite\'s-icon. It is a folder with a star. Come on there are real bookmarks you know.\r\nThird icon - View log? Nope that one has been used as an Error-icon since Windows 3.1 at least and is probably even recognisable as such by our Mac friends. \r\nFourth icon - Report? Yes, this I can see mainly due to the fact that the Warning-icon from Windows 3.1 era has be subsumed by various forums as a reportbutton. However to me it represents Warning (non-critical error). This is also one that I think most users would agree upon. Then again I might be wrong.\r\nFifth Icon - Remove? It is used in Windows to denote system-files (dll). \r\n\r\nSo even with Windows icons viewed by a Windows-centric observer the waters get muddy. \r\nIt was a good cross section of icons that could be used but would make the site less user-friendly. \r\n\r\nAgain nothing against you Hexen, just the use of Windows icons. And as a end note I\'m not a mac user, just to forestall any PC vs Mac flaming.

It might actually be better to define a gradient in the css - that way it scales properly and usually looks better than an image (it only works in modern browsers but screw old browsers) with an element that can have a variable shape and size.

and .rowb classes are just background colors, no gradients and no images. If you are going to use an image remember it has to look good in rows of various shapes and sizes, something like a thin vertical image which can be repeated horizontally and probably stretched vertically is what you want... good luck! It might actually be better to define a gradient in the css - that way it scales properly and usually looks better than an image (it only works in modern browsers but screw old browsers) with an element that can have a variable shape and size.

So like you say having a variable number top X is not great because its not usefully cacheable (although in actuality I doubt it would be used that much, so real load might not be a problem because of that). Also I cant really be bothered to code a variable top X.\n\nAnyway I looked into it and although adding a top 500 or top 1000 is easy to do if its a single page (once its generated its cached for 12/24 hrs so load isn\'t an issue) - and also paginating a set of results is relatively straightforward with the gazelle engine - for reasons that are too boring to explain its a huge PITA to add paginated results to the top10 page.

Or if you have further questions please post in the [url=/forums.php?action=viewforum&forumid=6]Help & Support forum[/url].\n\n[spoiler=notes] \n[b]Staff note:[/b]  We should no longer be using forum threads for stuff like reference rules/help information. ALL of that stuff should be in an article somewhere, preferably written as concisely as possible while still being thorough. The point of articles is partly so we can have \"proper\" webpages instead of forum threads for this kind of information - but staff/whoever can still have access to change them through the site software (instead of being static content you need a coder to change).[/size]  - obviously drafting stuff in threads is fine - this only applies to finished content [b] - mifune[/b][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[bg=grey,310px,left][color=white][font=Tahoma][size=4][align=center][b]Contents[/b][/align][/size][/font][/color][bg=white,300px][bg=270px] \n[url=#top]Welcome[/url]\n[url=#clients]Client whitelist[/url]\n[url=#upload]Uploading[/url]\n[url=#search]The search function[/url]\n[url=#credits]Credits and bonus shop[/url]\n[url=#requests]Requests[/url]\n[url=#freeleech]Automatic Freeleech[/url]\n[url=#collages]Collages[/url]\n[url=#tagging]Community Tagging[/url]\n[url=#mfd]Marked for Deletion[/url]\n[url=#badges]Badges and Medals[/url]\n[url=#classes]User Classes[/url]\n[url=#fls]Front Line Support[/url]\n[url=#bounty]Reward for dupe reports[/url] \n[url=#irc]IRC[/url] \n[url=#restrict]Restrictions on Editing Torrents/Editing Posts[/url] \n[url=#notifications]Notifications[/url] \n[url=#profile]Profile page[/url]\n[url=#settings]User Settings[/url]\n[/bg][/bg]\n[/bg]\n\n\n\n\n[#=clients]Client Whitelist[/#]\n\nWe now have a strict whitelist for torrent clients that are allowed/blacklist for clients that are banned.\n\n[whitelist]**NOTE: in the articles section this will appear as a table of the allowed clients.\n\n\n[#=upload]Uploading[/#] \n\nThere is no fixed announce url anymore - when you create a torrent you can leave it blank. The site uses your passkey to announce the torrent and add stats to you. \n\nRead the uploading rules and see[URL=http://torrents.empornium.me/forums.php?action=viewtopic&topicid=286] Uploading guide - a quick checklist[/url] [size=3]<-- change thread to article[/size]\n\n[b]Note[/b] the uploading form will not continue if the torrent does not contain enough basic information. \nAll presentations must follow the [url=/articles.php?topic=upload]uploading rules[/url]\n \nThere are various [url=/articles.php?topic=tutorials#uploading]help tutorials for uploading[/url]:\n[url=/articles.php?topic=presentation]Guide to Presentations [/url] - A useful guide to making a presentation \n[url=/articles.php?topic=tag_glossary]Tags - Glossary[/url] - A list of potential tags for use and their meanings.\n[url=/articles.php?topic=uploadchecklist]Uploading Checklist[/url] - A helpful guide to uploading\n[url=/articles.php?topic=utorrentupload]Uploading with uTorrent for Dummies[/url] - A small guide on how to upload with uTorrent\n[url=/articles.php?topic=vuzeupload]Uploading with Vuze for Dummies[/url] - A guide on how to download with Vuze \n 	\n\n[#=search]The search function[/#]\n\nOne of the biggest changes under the hood of the new site is the tagging system which allows for a much better search function. The search interface on the [url=/torrents.php]Browse torrents[/url] page is very similar to the one on the old site but will give you much better results.\n\nFor a more details on search and the differences between basic and advanced search please see the [url=/articles.php?topic=search]Search[/url] article in the help section.\n\n\n[#=credits]Credits and bonus shop[/#]\n\nThe bonus system has changed. Click on Credits (in the top right corner of the page) or Bonus in the drop-down list under your site nickname. \n\nThere are no longer any next credits the tracker awards credits at short regular intervals instead.\n\nUnder your user profile you will see a bonus log section, this is a record of how you have spent your credits (only visible to you).\n\n\n[#=requests]Requests[/#]\n\nThere is a completely new requests system linked from the top of the page. Instead of making forum posts you use the new system to enter a request and offer a bounty in GB from your upload credit. The bounty is deducted immediately once you make the offer, and others may also offer bounties to sweeten the request. \n\nPlease see the [url=/articles.php?topic=requests]Requests article[/url] in the help section for more info.\n\nnote: You must be a Good Perv with a ratio of at least 1.05 to be able to make a Request.\n\n[spoiler=notes]\nThere is now a link on the top of the page rather than using the forums like before.\nNote the requests Forum will now close.

The reason for it being marked will be clear on the torrent page.  If any user chooses to download a marked torrent any lost ratio etc. is on that users head.  It is a gamble if the users chooses to take that gamble and it fails so be it . . . do not come whining to staff about ratio issues arising from downloading torrents marked for deletion.\n\nIf you are the uploader and you want to fix the torrent visit the torrent page and edit the torrent when you are done click on the \"If you have fixed this upload make sure you have told the staff: By clicking here\" link (and then the yes you are sure prompt).

(this will install the basic site code + media)\n[*]do a few db things like build the raw gazelle db and import the articles/categories/bonus shop/awards data.\n[*]run the special importer code on the new site.

This is what I found/figured out about the connectable bug (I know this is overly simplstictly written, but I wanted to be as clear as possible)\r\n\r\nOkay so I couldn\'t help myself so I took a peek at the git for emp and I found some stuff.\r\nFirst it seems like there are a mashup between Gazelle/xbtt/ocelot. Or rather a gazelle/xbtt install that recived a ocelot transplant.\r\n\r\nI will try to make this as clear as possible. There are a bit of jumping between back-end and frontend to make this clearer\r\nL4nz/Gazelle branch\r\n1. In gazelle.sql we get the table structure and creation for xbt_files_users\r\n	on line 2924 we have \"`connectable` tinyint(4) NOT NULL DEFAULT \'1\'\"\r\n	So any new peers in this table gets set to TRUE\r\n2. xbt_files_users is queryed in /sections/torrents/peerlist.php \r\n\r\nL4nz/ocelot branch\r\n1. The only place xbt_files_users is used is on line 236-242\r\n		sql = \"INSERT INTO xbt_files_users (uid,fid,active,uploaded,downloaded,upspeed,downspeed,remaining,\" +\r\n		std::string(\"timespent,announced,ip,peer_id,useragent,mtime) VALUES \") + update_peer_buffer + \r\n				\" ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE active=VALUES(active), uploaded=VALUES(uploaded), \" +\r\n				\"downloaded=VALUES(downloaded), upspeed=VALUES(upspeed), \" +\r\n				\"downspeed=VALUES(downspeed), remaining=VALUES(remaining), \" +\r\n				\"timespent=VALUES(timespent), announced=VALUES(announced), \" + \r\n				\"mtime=VALUES(mtime)\";\r\n2. As you can see Connectable is never set or updated using the default value of true.\r\n\r\nIm not really sure how to fix this. I gotta do some thinking. I will look into how xbtt does this, but it looks lite the code is a bit spread out.[/quote]\r\n[quote=Mobbo]Just went over the ocelot code again, there are no code to check for connectability in the current code. Also client port isn\'t saved to the database as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nI have a few ideas on how to fix this, But way too tired to be coherent atm(insomnia isn\'t fun). I will try write it down if you want it.\r\n\r\n//Oscar[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote=mifune]Hi, thanks for taking a look at it.\r\n\r\nYeah it looked that way to me - no check for connectability in ocelot. I can just about read c++ (I mean I studied it about 20 years ago) but dont feel comfortable writing it or compiling it etc. I also dont know off the top of my head how you would check for connectability. (well I know how to do it by opening a socket on the target machine but is that really what a tracker is doing for tens of thousands of peers??)\r\n\r\nOh, are you looking at the L4nz/ocelot work branch btw? The master branches are just the original raw gazelle/ocelot projects, the work branches are the emp projects. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/L4nz/ocelot/tree/work\r\nhttps://github.com/L4nz/gazelle/tree/work\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of queries for xbt_files_users in the emp version that arent in the original. Not that that will matter of course, but there are also some changes to the ocelot code which afaics have no bearing on the connectable stuff... but just so you are looking at the latest correct version.\r\n\r\nAny help you can give would be much appreciated. I\'m kind of hoping you can grab the source from github, fix it, then mail me the fix and give me precise instructions on how to compile/install it on the test server... (then rinse repeat for any bugs/testing etc) unfortunatley lanz is the only one who can set up new contributer accounts on github else I would give you direct access so you could upload the fix yourself.\r\n\r\nLet me know how you get on.\r\n\r\nregards - mifune.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote=Mobbo]Well we are in the same boat then as far as c++ knowledge then. I\'m basicly channelling my 20 year old C knowledge, mixed in with a bit of java. \r\n\r\nConnectability is actually pretty simple, I think. You just try to open a socket and look at the resultcode. Using the socket() command [url=http://www.linuxhowtos.org/data/6/socket.txt]http://www.linuxhowtos.org/data/6/socket.txt[/url]\r\nI am looking at [url=http://www.linuxhowtos.org/C_C++/socket.htm]http://www.linuxhowtos.org/C_C++/socket.htm[/url]\r\nfor quick and dirty socketcode, only thing is that ocelot is the client in this scenario.\r\n\r\nIm gonna include a example on human readable diff file just so I can feed you updates in an intelligible fashion.\r\n\r\nLine 490 in worker.cpp\r\ndb->record_peer(record_str, ip, peer_id, headers[\"user-agent\"]);\r\nto\r\ndb->record_peer(record_str, ip, port, peer_id, headers[\"user-agent\"]);\r\n\r\nLine 65 in db.h\r\nvoid record_peer(std::string &record, std::string &ip, std::string &peer_id, std::string &useragent); // (uid,fid,active,peerid,useragent,ip,uploaded,downloaded,upspeed,downspeed,left,timespent,announces)\r\nto\r\nvoid record_peer(std::string &record, std::string &ip, std::string &port, std::string &peer_id, std::string &useragent); // (uid,fid,active,peerid,useragent,ip,port,uploaded,downloaded,upspeed,downspeed,left,timespent,announces)\r\n\r\nLine 127 in db.cpp\r\nvoid mysql::record_peer(std::string &record, std::string &ip, std::string &peer_id, std::string &useragent) {\r\nto\r\nvoid mysql::record_peer(std::string &record, std::string &ip, std::string &port, std::string &peer_id, std::string &useragent) {\r\n\r\nLine 133 in db.cpp\r\nq << record << mysqlpp::quote << ip << \',\' << mysqlpp::quote << peer_id << \',\' << mysqlpp::quote << useragent << \",\" << time(NULL) << \')\';\r\nto\r\nq << record << mysqlpp::quote << ip << \',\' << mysqlpp::quote << port << \',\' << mysqlpp::quote << peer_id << \',\' << mysqlpp::quote << useragent << \",\" << time(NULL) << \')\';\r\n\r\nThese changes would record the port into the peer list used in the flush_peers() function responsible for updating the xtb_files_users table. \r\n\r\nIs this good for you? I will get back to you about how to compile the files.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote=Mobbo]Do you use linux and/or windows to do your coding?[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote=mifune]For this project I have been working in ubuntu (in my day job I work in c# on windows more often than not).\r\n\r\nYou still appear to be working from the original (unaltered) project instead of the current one - you need to make sure you are looking at the work branch not the master branch. See https://github.com/L4nz/ocelot/blob/work/worker.cpp - the db->record_peer(record_str, ip, peer_id, headers[\"user-agent\"]); line is at 499 not 490.\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of recording the port? To do a socket test somewhere? Is that really how trackers test for connectability :hmmm: I had assumed as ocelot is the client, plus just the large number of peers/connections would mean there was some other method.\r\n\r\nIf possible I\'d prefer it if you sent me the actual files. You can email me at mifune@virginmedia.com[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote=Mobbo]Yeah the purpose of these mods are to do a connection test called in flush_peers.\r\nflush_peers() iterate through all the connected peers. \r\nWell there will be a hell of a lot in terms of Connections here. Maybe its better to move the connect test to worker.cpp then only one connect test will be made per announce from the bittorrent-client. \r\n\r\nGetting the data from the infohash and making a socket call is the only way I see how to make sure the client is connectable from the back end. I will check how xbtt does it. but xbtt\'s code is much more convoluted. \r\n\r\nI will make sure I\'m working from the correct files. I think I am. I was using VS to grab the line numbers, you never know with MS :)\r\n\r\nOkay I\'m gonna setup eclipse on my ubuntu machine and try to get the code to compile, so I can give you some help with compiling. \r\n\r\nCan you check the ip-field in xbt_files_users if it contains just an ipadress or an ip/port combo. Also a row count from xbt_files_users would be great, just to get an idea of the size.\r\n\r\nBTW Im in located Sweden. So you can get an idea of when I online.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote=Mobbo]I think you are right. Doing 1000000+ connections would be bad. I\'m going to give it some thought.\r\n\r\n//Oscar[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote=Clownius]Coming from a total noob here (i dont code).  \r\n\r\nBut would it be worth grabbing the xbtt code and seeing how it was checking connectability?  It may give you an idea? \r\n\r\nAnother question for Mifune is can you fork the current Emp code so you can add collaborators to your fork and we starting using your fork rather than the Lanz setup?  Just froma  quick look over github it appears collaborators can fork the current code that way but not those who are not.  Thinking longer term here too so we can have more than one person able to work on things in future.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote=mifune]I am not sure who this reply is going to now... lol. both of you?

(I am pretty busy atm with a RL project I have to get done but I will be around)\r\n\r\nMobbo: There are around 400,000 -> 500,000 peers on emp atm => that number of records in xbt_files_users, although that number is growing every day! I dont have the code on this machine (and I am too tired to boot up the other one right now, sorry) but I am fairly sure the xbt_files_users ip field is just the ip address :hmmm: You can probably work it out from the db structure?

If you would prefer to write it in c++ rather than pseudocode thats fine too.\n\nWe can add a port field in xbt_files_users no problem. (I\'ll add it to the gazelle project at the weekend).\n\nI think you are probably right that we should test once per user rather than once per connection, although we have to think about this a little as connectability is reported on a per connection basis in the interface. (ie. connectivity is displayed in the peerlists, which reflect the xbt_files_user records). hmm, I cannot see a problem with setting all of a users connection records to the same value although I do have a little niggle wondering if this is the right way... just because it seems a little weird that the value is stored per connection if its one value per peer? Anyway despite my niggles I think you probably have the right approach. (Assuming that mysql::flush() is called once per announce etc but you seem to know what you are doing).\n\nOh, where do you get an announce every 30 mins from? for some reason I thought the announce was every 15 mins although I may be wrong - the scheduler in gazelle is called every 15 mins from a cronjob anyway.\n \nI am really busy the next couple of days (and next week) with some RL work, but I\'ll be around daily.

So if resetting on a merge it will also be resetting on an edit - unless merging instead of just changing the edit time changed the actual post time - but thats a very non-intuitive way of having it in the interface. Ie. you would expect the post time at the top of the post to reflect the original post time not the time the post was merged into.\n\nIf it resets on an edit (this would actually be done by instead of just testing if the orig post time is < 15 mins ago testing that OR the edit post time < 15 mins ago) it would potentially mean you could edit an old post (if no-one else has posted after it) after any amount of time by merging a new post into it, then you can edit the whole of the old post. There is no way to only allow the user to edit the merged portion of the post because when you merge by definition it just appends the new post to the current post contents. (I mean it could be done but it would mean a fairly major rewrite of the way edits and merges are handled etc and its not going to happen...)\n\nStill this is probably the best solution; you can edit up to 15 mins after the last edit/merge was done.

There is an overhead just in terms of the connections, then the tests themselves are fairly fast when they are connectable but deadly slow when they aren\'t. The worker->announce() function does most of the work in the tracker, its where each peer is processed and as far as I can work out gets called every time a client sends data to the tracker (excepting scrapes). Having it hanging around waiting for unconnectable sockets to time out may just be a bad design choice. \r\n\r\nThe goal here is for all users to be connectable, so we record the status and display a red warning banner to them if they arent. But unless a user visits the site the information will go unused.\r\n\r\nOne approach could be that the default state for users is \'unset\' and they have to themselves go and run the connchecker on the site to get rid of the banner. This would mean we leave the tracker pretty much as is but with a small change to store the port with each connection. Then the scheduler (which already does some stuff with the connections table to get bonus credits) could store ip\'s for users in the users_connectable_status table with status = -1 (a flag for unset). When a user visits the site it checks for the most recent ip for that user and what its status is. The default connectable state for each record would be \'unset\' - which could display a red banner saying \'Are you connectable?\'. When they click on that it takes them to the connchecker page with the values filled in - whatever result they get is stored for that ip address. If they get a no result then the banner changes to \'You are not connectable!\' and if they get a yes result it removes the banner. Yes results would be stored until they are overwritten by a new check by the user, No results until they are overwritten or after a week. Ip addresses for a user that have not been checked would be displayed as \'unset/unknown\' in the peerlists. There would also be a button for staff to initiate a connection test for a users ip (although it would only be clickable/present when the user has an active connection).\r\n\r\nAlthough it would be faster if there were the same amount of connection tests in c++ this approach has the advantage of doing the least possible number of tests. Some users will not bother to test, and the delay from when the site first records a users ip and port to when they next login and do the test will mean the tests get delayed... and for users with dynamic ip\'s who kind of spam up any connection test regime if they dont login and their ip changes in the meantime it will skip doing a test unnecessarily. I think there will be less overall load even though the test is being done in php.\r\n\r\nA possible issue with this approach is dynamic ip\'s : users that get a new ip regularly could pretty annoyed with having to record a new result each time. One possibility could be a flag in each users settings for \'suppress no connect banner\', if a user has a frequently changing ip they could prove to us they are always connectable (by recording yes results for a while - staff/fls can see all the connectable records for each ip on each user page under the \'Personal\' stats box) and then staff could set the flag for that user so they arent bothered by them anymore. I was thinking we could have some system that did something clever with the subnet part of the address but on examining actual ip records of users, dynamic ip\'s are surprisingly often not that closely related.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway its a kind of different philosophy to the current system, we would be putting the burden on the users to prove they are connectable (or live with the red banner). \r\n\r\n\r\nIf we think is a possible way forward do we want to run it by the other staff as well? I cant really get to actually coding before the weekend realistically anyway. And I\'m presuming we will be able to make the relatively simple change to the ocelot code needed (and when I say \'we\' I mean Mobbo, or maybe the new guy).\r\n\r\n',NULL,NULL),(48012,6112,84499,'2012-10-16 19:30:24','\ncool looks good :gjob:\n\n\none thing: You didnt add a [code]port=VALUES(port)[/code] to the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause.

There is no other way to do this that can work. It\'s very hard to even guess at an upper bound on how long this might take. I\'d have to do a little digging on the best way to tell if the socket is truly connectable, but at the most basic level you\'d let the TCP handshake complete and then close the socket cleanly, to be nice. That involves the exchange of at least 6 packets, each with an associated round trip time. You\'re going to have to pick a timeout that is reasonable so that you don\'t end up with lots of false negatives. A certain number of checks can be done in parallel, but that amounts to a hell of a lot of connections, and a lot of waiting on network I/O.\r\n\r\nAs a back of the envelope calculation, if you allow a 10s maximum for the connectivity test (which might even be too aggressive), and figure 5% are not connectable with the average for those that are connectable at 5s (a wild guess given this is a world-wide site), that puts you at 525,000s or around 145 hours of total checking time. Some of that can be parallelized or broken up into batches, but there\'s obviously a limit to the number of threads you want to have running, or the number of outbound ports you want this to suck up.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think automated connection testing is a pretty tall order.
